HEART OF DARKNESS 
 
 
BY JOSEPH CONRAD 
 
 
 
I 
 
THE NELLIE A CRUISING YAWL SWUNG TO HER ANCHOR WITHOUT A FLUTTER OF 
THE SAILS AND WAS AT REST THE FLOOD HAD MADE THE WIND WAS NEARLY 
CALM AND BEING BOUND DOWN THE RIVER THE ONLY THING FOR IT WAS TO COME 
TO AND WAIT FOR THE TURN OF THE TIDE 
 
THE SEAREACH OF THE THAMES STRETCHED BEFORE US LIKE THE BEGINNING OF 
AN INTERMINABLE WATERWAY IN THE OFFING THE SEA AND THE SKY WERE WELDED 
TOGETHER WITHOUT A JOINT AND IN THE LUMINOUS SPACE THE TANNED SAILS 
OF THE BARGES DRIFTING UP WITH THE TIDE SEEMED TO STAND STILL IN RED 
CLUSTERS OF CANVAS SHARPLY PEAKED WITH GLEAMS OF VARNISHED SPRITS A 
HAZE RESTED ON THE LOW SHORES THAT RAN OUT TO SEA IN VANISHING FLATNESS 
THE AIR WAS DARK ABOVE GRAVESEND AND FARTHER BACK STILL SEEMED 
CONDENSED INTO A MOURNFUL GLOOM BROODING MOTIONLESS OVER THE BIGGEST 
AND THE GREATEST TOWN ON EARTH 
 
THE DIRECTOR OF COMPANIES WAS OUR CAPTAIN AND OUR HOST WE FOUR 
AFFECTIONATELY WATCHED HIS BACK AS HE STOOD IN THE BOWS LOOKING TO 
SEAWARD ON THE WHOLE RIVER THERE WAS NOTHING THAT LOOKED HALF SO 
NAUTICAL HE RESEMBLED A PILOT WHICH TO A SEAMAN IS TRUSTWORTHINESS 
PERSONIFIED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALIZE HIS WORK WAS NOT OUT THERE IN 
THE LUMINOUS ESTUARY BUT BEHIND HIM WITHIN THE BROODING GLOOM 
 
BETWEEN US THERE WAS AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID SOMEWHERE THE BOND OF 
THE SEA BESIDES HOLDING OUR HEARTS TOGETHER THROUGH LONG PERIODS OF 
SEPARATION IT HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING US TOLERANT OF EACH OTHERS 
YARNSAND EVEN CONVICTIONS THE LAWYERTHE BEST OF OLD FELLOWSHAD 
BECAUSE OF HIS MANY YEARS AND MANY VIRTUES THE ONLY CUSHION ON DECK 
AND WAS LYING ON THE ONLY RUG THE ACCOUNTANT HAD BROUGHT OUT ALREADY A 
BOX OF DOMINOES AND WAS TOYING ARCHITECTURALLY WITH THE BONES MARLOW 
SAT CROSSLEGGED RIGHT AFT LEANING AGAINST THE MIZZENMAST HE HAD 
SUNKEN CHEEKS A YELLOW COMPLEXION A STRAIGHT BACK AN ASCETIC ASPECT 
AND WITH HIS ARMS DROPPED THE PALMS OF HANDS OUTWARDS RESEMBLED AN 
IDOL THE DIRECTOR SATISFIED THE ANCHOR HAD GOOD HOLD MADE HIS WAY 
AFT AND SAT DOWN AMONGST US WE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS LAZILY AFTERWARDS 
THERE WAS SILENCE ON BOARD THE YACHT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER WE DID 
NOT BEGIN THAT GAME OF DOMINOES WE FELT MEDITATIVE AND FIT FOR NOTHING 
BUT PLACID STARING THE DAY WAS ENDING IN A SERENITY OF STILL AND 
EXQUISITE BRILLIANCE THE WATER SHONE PACIFICALLY THE SKY WITHOUT A 
SPECK WAS A BENIGN IMMENSITY OF UNSTAINED LIGHT THE VERY MIST ON THE 
ESSEX MARSHES WAS LIKE A GAUZY AND RADIANT FABRIC HUNG FROM THE WOODED 
RISES INLAND AND DRAPING THE LOW SHORES IN DIAPHANOUS FOLDS ONLY THE 
GLOOM TO THE WEST BROODING OVER THE UPPER REACHES BECAME MORE SOMBER 
EVERY MINUTE AS IF ANGERED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SUN 
 
AND AT LAST IN ITS CURVED AND IMPERCEPTIBLE FALL THE SUN SANK LOW AND 
FROM GLOWING WHITE CHANGED TO A DULL RED WITHOUT RAYS AND WITHOUT HEAT 
AS IF ABOUT TO GO OUT SUDDENLY STRICKEN TO DEATH BY THE TOUCH OF THAT 
GLOOM BROODING OVER A CROWD OF MEN 
 
FORTHWITH A CHANGE CAME OVER THE WATERS AND THE SERENITY BECAME LESS 
BRILLIANT BUT MORE PROFOUND THE OLD RIVER IN ITS BROAD REACH RESTED 
UNRUFFLED AT THE DECLINE OF DAY AFTER AGES OF GOOD SERVICE DONE TO THE 
RACE THAT PEOPLED ITS BANKS SPREAD OUT IN THE TRANQUIL DIGNITY OF A 
WATERWAY LEADING TO THE UTTERMOST ENDS OF THE EARTH WE LOOKED AT THE 
VENERABLE STREAM NOT IN THE VIVID FLUSH OF A SHORT DAY THAT COMES AND 
DEPARTS FOR EVER BUT IN THE AUGUST LIGHT OF ABIDING MEMORIES AND 
INDEED NOTHING IS EASIER FOR A MAN WHO HAS AS THE PHRASE GOES 
FOLLOWED THE SEA WITH REVERENCE AND AFFECTION THAN TO EVOKE THE 
GREAT SPIRIT OF THE PAST UPON THE LOWER REACHES OF THE THAMES THE TIDAL 
CURRENT RUNS TO AND FRO IN ITS UNCEASING SERVICE CROWDED WITH MEMORIES 
OF MEN AND SHIPS IT HAD BORNE TO THE REST OF HOME OR TO THE BATTLES 
OF THE SEA IT HAD KNOWN AND SERVED ALL THE MEN OF WHOM THE NATION IS 
PROUD FROM SIR FRANCIS DRAKE TO SIR JOHN FRANKLIN KNIGHTS ALL TITLED 
AND UNTITLEDTHE GREAT KNIGHTSERRANT OF THE SEA IT HAD BORNE ALL THE 
SHIPS WHOSE NAMES ARE LIKE JEWELS FLASHING IN THE NIGHT OF TIME FROM 
THE GOLDEN HIND RETURNING WITH HER ROUND FLANKS FULL OF TREASURE TO BE 
VISITED BY THE QUEENS HIGHNESS AND THUS PASS OUT OF THE GIGANTIC TALE 
TO THE EREBUS AND TERROR BOUND ON OTHER CONQUESTSAND THAT NEVER 
RETURNED IT HAD KNOWN THE SHIPS AND THE MEN THEY HAD SAILED FROM 
DEPTFORD FROM GREENWICH FROM ERITHTHE ADVENTURERS AND THE SETTLERS 
KINGS SHIPS AND THE SHIPS OF MEN ON CHANGE CAPTAINS ADMIRALS THE 
DARK INTERLOPERS OF THE EASTERN TRADE AND THE COMMISSIONED GENERALS 
OF EAST INDIA FLEETS HUNTERS FOR GOLD OR PURSUERS OF FAME THEY ALL 
HAD GONE OUT ON THAT STREAM BEARING THE SWORD AND OFTEN THE TORCH 
MESSENGERS OF THE MIGHT WITHIN THE LAND BEARERS OF A SPARK FROM THE 
SACRED FIRE WHAT GREATNESS HAD NOT FLOATED ON THE EBB OF THAT RIVER 
INTO THE MYSTERY OF AN UNKNOWN EARTH    THE DREAMS OF MEN THE SEED 
OF COMMONWEALTHS THE GERMS OF EMPIRES 
 
THE SUN SET THE DUSK FELL ON THE STREAM AND LIGHTS BEGAN TO APPEAR 
ALONG THE SHORE THE CHAPMAN LIGHTHOUSE A THREELEGGED THING ERECT ON A 
MUDFLAT SHONE STRONGLY LIGHTS OF SHIPS MOVED IN THE FAIRWAYA GREAT 
STIR OF LIGHTS GOING UP AND GOING DOWN AND FARTHER WEST ON THE UPPER 
REACHES THE PLACE OF THE MONSTROUS TOWN WAS STILL MARKED OMINOUSLY ON 
THE SKY A BROODING GLOOM IN SUNSHINE A LURID GLARE UNDER THE STARS 
 
AND THIS ALSO SAID MARLOW SUDDENLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE DARK PLACES 
OF THE EARTH 
 
HE WAS THE ONLY MAN OF US WHO STILL FOLLOWED THE SEA THE WORST THAT 
COULD BE SAID OF HIM WAS THAT HE DID NOT REPRESENT HIS CLASS HE WAS A 
SEAMAN BUT HE WAS A WANDERER TOO WHILE MOST SEAMEN LEAD IF ONE MAY 
SO EXPRESS IT A SEDENTARY LIFE THEIR MINDS ARE OF THE STAYATHOME 
ORDER AND THEIR HOME IS ALWAYS WITH THEMTHE SHIP AND SO IS THEIR 
COUNTRYTHE SEA ONE SHIP IS VERY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER AND THE SEA IS 
ALWAYS THE SAME IN THE IMMUTABILITY OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS THE FOREIGN 
SHORES THE FOREIGN FACES THE CHANGING IMMENSITY OF LIFE GLIDE PAST 
VEILED NOT BY A SENSE OF MYSTERY BUT BY A SLIGHTLY DISDAINFUL IGNORANCE 
FOR THERE IS NOTHING MYSTERIOUS TO A SEAMAN UNLESS IT BE THE SEA ITSELF 
WHICH IS THE MISTRESS OF HIS EXISTENCE AND AS INSCRUTABLE AS DESTINY 
FOR THE REST AFTER HIS HOURS OF WORK A CASUAL STROLL OR A CASUAL SPREE 
ON SHORE SUFFICES TO UNFOLD FOR HIM THE SECRET OF A WHOLE CONTINENT 
AND GENERALLY HE FINDS THE SECRET NOT WORTH KNOWING THE YARNS OF SEAMEN 
HAVE A DIRECT SIMPLICITY THE WHOLE MEANING OF WHICH LIES WITHIN THE 
SHELL OF A CRACKED NUT BUT MARLOW WAS NOT TYPICAL IF HIS PROPENSITY 
TO SPIN YARNS BE EXCEPTED AND TO HIM THE MEANING OF AN EPISODE WAS NOT 
INSIDE LIKE A KERNEL BUT OUTSIDE ENVELOPING THE TALE WHICH BROUGHT IT 
OUT ONLY AS A GLOW BRINGS OUT A HAZE IN THE LIKENESS OF ONE OF THESE 
MISTY HALOS THAT SOMETIMES ARE MADE VISIBLE BY THE SPECTRAL ILLUMINATION 
OF MOONSHINE 
 
HIS REMARK DID NOT SEEM AT ALL SURPRISING IT WAS JUST LIKE MARLOW 
IT WAS ACCEPTED IN SILENCE NO ONE TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GRUNT EVEN AND 
PRESENTLY HE SAID VERY SLOW 
 
I WAS THINKING OF VERY OLD TIMES WHEN THE ROMANS FIRST CAME HERE 
NINETEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGOTHE OTHER DAY    LIGHT CAME OUT OF THIS 
RIVER SINCEYOU SAY KNIGHTS YES BUT IT IS LIKE A RUNNING BLAZE ON 
A PLAIN LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE CLOUDS WE LIVE IN THE 
FLICKERMAY IT LAST AS LONG AS THE OLD EARTH KEEPS ROLLING BUT 
DARKNESS WAS HERE YESTERDAY IMAGINE THE FEELINGS OF A COMMANDER OF 
A FINEWHAT DYE CALL EMTRIREME IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ORDERED 
SUDDENLY TO THE NORTH RUN OVERLAND ACROSS THE GAULS IN A HURRY PUT IN 
CHARGE OF ONE OF THESE CRAFT THE LEGIONARIESA WONDERFUL LOT OF HANDY 
MEN THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TOOUSED TO BUILD APPARENTLY BY THE HUNDRED 
IN A MONTH OR TWO IF WE MAY BELIEVE WHAT WE READ IMAGINE HIM HERETHE 
VERY END OF THE WORLD A SEA THE COLOR OF LEAD A SKY THE COLOR OF 
SMOKE A KIND OF SHIP ABOUT AS RIGID AS A CONCERTINAAND GOING UP THIS 
RIVER WITH STORES OR ORDERS OR WHAT YOU LIKE SANDBANKS MARSHES 
FORESTS SAVAGESPRECIOUS LITTLE TO EAT FIT FOR A CIVILIZED MAN 
NOTHING BUT THAMES WATER TO DRINK NO FALERNIAN WINE HERE NO GOING 
ASHORE HERE AND THERE A MILITARY CAMP LOST IN A WILDERNESS LIKE A 
NEEDLE IN A BUNDLE OF HAYCOLD FOG TEMPESTS DISEASE EXILE AND 
DEATHDEATH SKULKING IN THE AIR IN THE WATER IN THE BUSH THEY MUST 
HAVE BEEN DYING LIKE FLIES HERE OH YESHE DID IT DID IT VERY WELL 
TOO NO DOUBT AND WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER EXCEPT 
AFTERWARDS TO BRAG OF WHAT HE HAD GONE THROUGH IN HIS TIME PERHAPS 
THEY WERE MEN ENOUGH TO FACE THE DARKNESS AND PERHAPS HE WAS CHEERED 
BY KEEPING HIS EYE ON A CHANCE OF PROMOTION TO THE FLEET AT RAVENNA 
BYANDBY IF HE HAD GOOD FRIENDS IN ROME AND SURVIVED THE AWFUL 
CLIMATE OR THINK OF A DECENT YOUNG CITIZEN IN A TOGAPERHAPS TOO 
MUCH DICE YOU KNOWCOMING OUT HERE IN THE TRAIN OF SOME PREFECT OR 
TAXGATHERER OR TRADER EVEN TO MEND HIS FORTUNES LAND IN A SWAMP 
MARCH THROUGH THE WOODS AND IN SOME INLAND POST FEEL THE SAVAGERY THE 
UTTER SAVAGERY HAD CLOSED ROUND HIMALL THAT MYSTERIOUS LIFE OF THE 
WILDERNESS THAT STIRS IN THE FOREST IN THE JUNGLES IN THE HEARTS OF 
WILD MEN THERES NO INITIATION EITHER INTO SUCH MYSTERIES HE HAS TO 
LIVE IN THE MIDST OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH IS ALSO DETESTABLE AND 
IT HAS A FASCINATION TOO THAT GOES TO WORK UPON HIM THE FASCINATION 
OF THE ABOMINATIONYOU KNOW IMAGINE THE GROWING REGRETS THE LONGING 
TO ESCAPE THE POWERLESS DISGUST THE SURRENDER THE HATE 
 
HE PAUSED 
 
MIND HE BEGAN AGAIN LIFTING ONE ARM FROM THE ELBOW THE PALM OF THE 
HAND OUTWARDS SO THAT WITH HIS LEGS FOLDED BEFORE HIM HE HAD THE 
POSE OF A BUDDHA PREACHING IN EUROPEAN CLOTHES AND WITHOUT A 
LOTUSFLOWERMIND NONE OF US WOULD FEEL EXACTLY LIKE THIS WHAT SAVES 
US IS EFFICIENCYTHE DEVOTION TO EFFICIENCY BUT THESE CHAPS WERE NOT 
MUCH ACCOUNT REALLY THEY WERE NO COLONISTS THEIR ADMINISTRATION WAS 
MERELY A SQUEEZE AND NOTHING MORE I SUSPECT THEY WERE CONQUERORS AND 
FOR THAT YOU WANT ONLY BRUTE FORCENOTHING TO BOAST OF WHEN YOU HAVE 
IT SINCE YOUR STRENGTH IS JUST AN ACCIDENT ARISING FROM THE WEAKNESS OF 
OTHERS THEY GRABBED WHAT THEY COULD GET FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT WAS TO 
BE GOT IT WAS JUST ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE AGGRAVATED MURDER ON A GREAT 
SCALE AND MEN GOING AT IT BLINDAS IS VERY PROPER FOR THOSE WHO TACKLE 
A DARKNESS THE CONQUEST OF THE EARTH WHICH MOSTLY MEANS THE TAKING 
IT AWAY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION OR SLIGHTLY FLATTER 
NOSES THAN OURSELVES IS NOT A PRETTY THING WHEN YOU LOOK INTO IT TOO 
MUCH WHAT REDEEMS IT IS THE IDEA ONLY AN IDEA AT THE BACK OF IT NOT 
A SENTIMENTAL PRETENSE BUT AN IDEA AND AN UNSELFISH BELIEF IN THE 
IDEASOMETHING YOU CAN SET UP AND BOW DOWN BEFORE AND OFFER A 
SACRIFICE TO    
 
HE BROKE OFF FLAMES GLIDED IN THE RIVER SMALL GREEN FLAMES RED 
FLAMES WHITE FLAMES PURSUING OVERTAKING JOINING CROSSING EACH 
OTHERTHEN SEPARATING SLOWLY OR HASTILY THE TRAFFIC OF THE GREAT CITY 
WENT ON IN THE DEEPENING NIGHT UPON THE SLEEPLESS RIVER WE LOOKED ON 
WAITING PATIENTLYTHERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO TILL THE END OF 
THE FLOOD BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTER A LONG SILENCE WHEN HE SAID IN 
A HESITATING VOICE I SUPPOSE YOU FELLOWS REMEMBER I DID ONCE TURN 
FRESHWATER SAILOR FOR A BIT THAT WE KNEW WE WERE FATED BEFORE 
THE EBB BEGAN TO RUN TO HEAR ABOUT ONE OF MARLOWS INCONCLUSIVE 
EXPERIENCES 
 
I DONT WANT TO BOTHER YOU MUCH WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO ME PERSONALLY 
HE BEGAN SHOWING IN THIS REMARK THE WEAKNESS OF MANY TELLERS OF TALES 
WHO SEEM SO OFTEN UNAWARE OF WHAT THEIR AUDIENCE WOULD BEST LIKE TO 
HEAR YET TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF IT ON ME YOU OUGHT TO KNOW HOW I 
GOT OUT THERE WHAT I SAW HOW I WENT UP THAT RIVER TO THE PLACE WHERE I 
FIRST MET THE POOR CHAP IT WAS THE FARTHEST POINT OF NAVIGATION AND THE 
CULMINATING POINT OF MY EXPERIENCE IT SEEMED SOMEHOW TO THROW A KIND OF 
LIGHT ON EVERYTHING ABOUT MEAND INTO MY THOUGHTS IT WAS SOMBER ENOUGH 
TOOAND PITIFULNOT EXTRAORDINARY IN ANY WAYNOT VERY CLEAR EITHER 
NO NOT VERY CLEAR AND YET IT SEEMED TO THROW A KIND OF LIGHT 
 
I HAD THEN AS YOU REMEMBER JUST RETURNED TO LONDON AFTER A LOT OF 
INDIAN OCEAN PACIFIC CHINA SEASA REGULAR DOSE OF THE EASTSIX YEARS 
OR SO AND I WAS LOAFING ABOUT HINDERING YOU FELLOWS IN YOUR WORK AND 
INVADING YOUR HOMES JUST AS THOUGH I HAD GOT A HEAVENLY MISSION TO 
CIVILIZE YOU IT WAS VERY FINE FOR A TIME BUT AFTER A BIT I DID GET 
TIRED OF RESTING THEN I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A SHIPI SHOULD THINK THE 
HARDEST WORK ON EARTH BUT THE SHIPS WOULDNT EVEN LOOK AT ME AND I GOT 
TIRED OF THAT GAME TOO 
 
NOW WHEN I WAS A LITTLE CHAP I HAD A PASSION FOR MAPS I WOULD LOOK FOR 
HOURS AT SOUTH AMERICA OR AFRICA OR AUSTRALIA AND LOSE MYSELF IN ALL 
THE GLORIES OF EXPLORATION AT THAT TIME THERE WERE MANY BLANK SPACES ON 
THE EARTH AND WHEN I SAW ONE THAT LOOKED PARTICULARLY INVITING ON A MAP 
BUT THEY ALL LOOK THAT I WOULD PUT MY FINGER ON IT AND SAY WHEN 
I GROW UP I WILL GO THERE THE NORTH POLE WAS ONE OF THESE PLACES I 
REMEMBER WELL I HAVENT BEEN THERE YET AND SHALL NOT TRY NOW THE 
GLAMOURS OFF OTHER PLACES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE EQUATOR AND IN 
EVERY SORT OF LATITUDE ALL OVER THE TWO HEMISPHERES I HAVE BEEN IN SOME 
OF THEM AND    WELL WE WONT TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE WAS ONE 
YETTHE BIGGEST THE MOST BLANK SO TO SPEAKTHAT I HAD A HANKERING 
AFTER 
 
TRUE BY THIS TIME IT WAS NOT A BLANK SPACE ANY MORE IT HAD GOT FILLED 
SINCE MY BOYHOOD WITH RIVERS AND LAKES AND NAMES IT HAD CEASED TO BE 
A BLANK SPACE OF DELIGHTFUL MYSTERYA WHITE PATCH FOR A BOY TO DREAM 
GLORIOUSLY OVER IT HAD BECOME A PLACE OF DARKNESS BUT THERE WAS IN IT 
ONE RIVER ESPECIALLY A MIGHTY BIG RIVER THAT YOU COULD SEE ON THE MAP 
RESEMBLING AN IMMENSE SNAKE UNCOILED WITH ITS HEAD IN THE SEA ITS 
BODY AT REST CURVING AFAR OVER A VAST COUNTRY AND ITS TAIL LOST IN THE 
DEPTHS OF THE LAND AND AS I LOOKED AT THE MAP OF IT IN A SHOPWINDOW 
IT FASCINATED ME AS A SNAKE WOULD A BIRDA SILLY LITTLE BIRD THEN I 
REMEMBERED THERE WAS A BIG CONCERN A COMPANY FOR TRADE ON THAT RIVER 
DASH IT ALL I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THEY CANT TRADE WITHOUT USING SOME 
KIND OF CRAFT ON THAT LOT OF FRESH WATERSTEAMBOATS WHY SHOULDNT I 
TRY TO GET CHARGE OF ONE I WENT ON ALONG FLEET STREET BUT COULD NOT 
SHAKE OFF THE IDEA THE SNAKE HAD CHARMED ME 
 
YOU UNDERSTAND IT WAS A CONTINENTAL CONCERN THAT TRADING SOCIETY BUT 
I HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONS LIVING ON THE CONTINENT BECAUSE ITS CHEAP 
AND NOT SO NASTY AS IT LOOKS THEY SAY 
 
I AM SORRY TO OWN I BEGAN TO WORRY THEM THIS WAS ALREADY A FRESH 
DEPARTURE FOR ME I WAS NOT USED TO GET THINGS THAT WAY YOU KNOW I 
ALWAYS WENT MY OWN ROAD AND ON MY OWN LEGS WHERE I HAD A MIND TO GO I 
WOULDNT HAVE BELIEVED IT OF MYSELF BUT THENYOU SEEI FELT SOMEHOW 
I MUST GET THERE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK SO I WORRIED THEM THE MEN SAID 
MY DEAR FELLOW AND DID NOTHING THENWOULD YOU BELIEVE ITI TRIED 
THE WOMEN I CHARLIE MARLOW SET THE WOMEN TO WORKTO GET A JOB 
HEAVENS WELL YOU SEE THE NOTION DROVE ME I HAD AN AUNT A DEAR 
ENTHUSIASTIC SOUL SHE WROTE IT WILL BE DELIGHTFUL I AM READY TO DO 
ANYTHING ANYTHING FOR YOU IT IS A GLORIOUS IDEA I KNOW THE WIFE OF A 
VERY HIGH PERSONAGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO A MAN WHO HAS LOTS 
OF INFLUENCE WITH C C SHE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE NO END OF FUSS 
TO GET ME APPOINTED SKIPPER OF A RIVER STEAMBOAT IF SUCH WAS MY FANCY 
 
I GOT MY APPOINTMENTOF COURSE AND I GOT IT VERY QUICK IT APPEARS 
THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVED NEWS THAT ONE OF THEIR CAPTAINS HAD BEEN KILLED 
IN A SCUFFLE WITH THE NATIVES THIS WAS MY CHANCE AND IT MADE ME THE 
MORE ANXIOUS TO GO IT WAS ONLY MONTHS AND MONTHS AFTERWARDS WHEN I 
MADE THE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE BODY THAT I HEARD THE 
ORIGINAL QUARREL AROSE FROM A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT SOME HENS YES 
TWO BLACK HENS FRESLEVENTHAT WAS THE FELLOWS NAME A DANETHOUGHT 
HIMSELF WRONGED SOMEHOW IN THE BARGAIN SO HE WENT ASHORE AND STARTED TO 
HAMMER THE CHIEF OF THE VILLAGE WITH A STICK OH IT DIDNT SURPRISE 
ME IN THE LEAST TO HEAR THIS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE TOLD THAT 
FRESLEVEN WAS THE GENTLEST QUIETEST CREATURE THAT EVER WALKED ON TWO 
LEGS NO DOUBT HE WAS BUT HE HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS ALREADY OUT 
THERE ENGAGED IN THE NOBLE CAUSE YOU KNOW AND HE PROBABLY FELT THE 
NEED AT LAST OF ASSERTING HIS SELFRESPECT IN SOME WAY THEREFORE HE 
WHACKED THE OLD NIGGER MERCILESSLY WHILE A BIG CROWD OF HIS PEOPLE 
WATCHED HIM THUNDERSTRUCK TILL SOME MANI WAS TOLD THE CHIEFS 
SONIN DESPERATION AT HEARING THE OLD CHAP YELL MADE A TENTATIVE JAB 
WITH A SPEAR AT THE WHITE MANAND OF COURSE IT WENT QUITE EASY BETWEEN 
THE SHOULDERBLADES THEN THE WHOLE POPULATION CLEARED INTO THE FOREST 
EXPECTING ALL KINDS OF CALAMITIES TO HAPPEN WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND 
THE STEAMER FRESLEVEN COMMANDED LEFT ALSO IN A BAD PANIC IN CHARGE OF 
THE ENGINEER I BELIEVE AFTERWARDS NOBODY SEEMED TO TROUBLE MUCH 
ABOUT FRESLEVENS REMAINS TILL I GOT OUT AND STEPPED INTO HIS SHOES I 
COULDNT LET IT REST THOUGH BUT WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED AT LAST TO 
MEET MY PREDECESSOR THE GRASS GROWING THROUGH HIS RIBS WAS TALL ENOUGH 
TO HIDE HIS BONES THEY WERE ALL THERE THE SUPERNATURAL BEING HAD NOT 
BEEN TOUCHED AFTER HE FELL AND THE VILLAGE WAS DESERTED THE HUTS GAPED 
BLACK ROTTING ALL ASKEW WITHIN THE FALLEN ENCLOSURES A CALAMITY 
HAD COME TO IT SURE ENOUGH THE PEOPLE HAD VANISHED MAD TERROR HAD 
SCATTERED THEM MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THROUGH THE BUSH AND THEY HAD 
NEVER RETURNED WHAT BECAME OF THE HENS I DONT KNOW EITHER I SHOULD 
THINK THE CAUSE OF PROGRESS GOT THEM ANYHOW HOWEVER THROUGH THIS 
GLORIOUS AFFAIR I GOT MY APPOINTMENT BEFORE I HAD FAIRLY BEGUN TO HOPE 
FOR IT 
 
I FLEW AROUND LIKE MAD TO GET READY AND BEFORE FORTYEIGHT HOURS I 
WAS CROSSING THE CHANNEL TO SHOW MYSELF TO MY EMPLOYERS AND SIGN THE 
CONTRACT IN A VERY FEW HOURS I ARRIVED IN A CITY THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME 
THINK OF A WHITED SEPULCHER PREJUDICE NO DOUBT I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN 
FINDING THE COMPANYS OFFICES IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING IN THE TOWN 
AND EVERYBODY I MET WAS FULL OF IT THEY WERE GOING TO RUN AN OVERSEA 
EMPIRE AND MAKE NO END OF COIN BY TRADE 
 
A NARROW AND DESERTED STREET IN DEEP SHADOW HIGH HOUSES INNUMERABLE 
WINDOWS WITH VENETIAN BLINDS A DEAD SILENCE GRASS SPROUTING BETWEEN 
THE STONES IMPOSING CARRIAGE ARCHWAYS RIGHT AND LEFT IMMENSE DOUBLE 
DOORS STANDING PONDEROUSLY AJAR I SLIPPED THROUGH ONE OF THESE CRACKS 
WENT UP A SWEPT AND UNGARNISHED STAIRCASE AS ARID AS A DESERT AND 
OPENED THE FIRST DOOR I CAME TO TWO WOMEN ONE FAT AND THE OTHER SLIM 
SAT ON STRAWBOTTOMED CHAIRS KNITTING BLACK WOOL THE SLIM ONE GOT UP 
AND WALKED STRAIGHT AT MESTILL KNITTING WITH DOWNCAST EYESAND ONLY 
JUST AS I BEGAN TO THINK OF GETTING OUT OF HER WAY AS YOU WOULD FOR A 
SOMNAMBULIST STOOD STILL AND LOOKED UP HER DRESS WAS AS PLAIN AS AN 
UMBRELLACOVER AND SHE TURNED ROUND WITHOUT A WORD AND PRECEDED ME 
INTO A WAITINGROOM I GAVE MY NAME AND LOOKED ABOUT DEAL TABLE IN 
THE MIDDLE PLAIN CHAIRS ALL ROUND THE WALLS ON ONE END A LARGE SHINING 
MAP MARKED WITH ALL THE COLORS OF A RAINBOW THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF 
REDGOOD TO SEE AT ANY TIME BECAUSE ONE KNOWS THAT SOME REAL WORK 
IS DONE IN THERE A DEUCE OF A LOT OF BLUE A LITTLE GREEN SMEARS OF 
ORANGE AND ON THE EAST COAST A PURPLE PATCH TO SHOW WHERE THE JOLLY 
PIONEERS OF PROGRESS DRINK THE JOLLY LAGERBEER HOWEVER I WASNT GOING 
INTO ANY OF THESE I WAS GOING INTO THE YELLOW DEAD IN THE CENTER AND 
THE RIVER WAS THEREFASCINATINGDEADLYLIKE A SNAKE OUGH A DOOR 
OPENED A WHITEHAIRED SECRETARIAL HEAD BUT WEARING A COMPASSIONATE 
EXPRESSION APPEARED AND A SKINNY FOREFINGER BECKONED ME INTO THE 
SANCTUARY ITS LIGHT WAS DIM AND A HEAVY WRITINGDESK SQUATTED IN 
THE MIDDLE FROM BEHIND THAT STRUCTURE CAME OUT AN IMPRESSION OF PALE 
PLUMPNESS IN A FROCKCOAT THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF HE WAS FIVE FEET 
SIX I SHOULD JUDGE AND HAD HIS GRIP ON THE HANDLEEND OF EVER SO MANY 
MILLIONS HE SHOOK HANDS I FANCY MURMURED VAGUELY WAS SATISFIED WITH 
MY FRENCH BON VOYAGE 
 
IN ABOUT FORTYFIVE SECONDS I FOUND MYSELF AGAIN IN THE WAITINGROOM 
WITH THE COMPASSIONATE SECRETARY WHO FULL OF DESOLATION AND SYMPATHY 
MADE ME SIGN SOME DOCUMENT I BELIEVE I UNDERTOOK AMONGST OTHER THINGS 
NOT TO DISCLOSE ANY TRADE SECRETS WELL I AM NOT GOING TO 
 
I BEGAN TO FEEL SLIGHTLY UNEASY YOU KNOW I AM NOT USED TO SUCH 
CEREMONIES AND THERE WAS SOMETHING OMINOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IT 
WAS JUST AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN LET INTO SOME CONSPIRACYI DONT 
KNOWSOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT AND I WAS GLAD TO GET OUT IN THE OUTER 
ROOM THE TWO WOMEN KNITTED BLACK WOOL FEVERISHLY PEOPLE WERE ARRIVING 
AND THE YOUNGER ONE WAS WALKING BACK AND FORTH INTRODUCING THEM THE 
OLD ONE SAT ON HER CHAIR HER FLAT CLOTH SLIPPERS WERE PROPPED UP ON 
A FOOTWARMER AND A CAT REPOSED ON HER LAP SHE WORE A STARCHED 
WHITE AFFAIR ON HER HEAD HAD A WART ON ONE CHEEK AND SILVERRIMMED 
SPECTACLES HUNG ON THE TIP OF HER NOSE SHE GLANCED AT ME ABOVE THE 
GLASSES THE SWIFT AND INDIFFERENT PLACIDITY OF THAT LOOK TROUBLED ME 
TWO YOUTHS WITH FOOLISH AND CHEERY COUNTENANCES WERE BEING PILOTED OVER 
AND SHE THREW AT THEM THE SAME QUICK GLANCE OF UNCONCERNED WISDOM SHE 
SEEMED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM AND ABOUT ME TOO AN EERIE FEELING CAME 
OVER ME SHE SEEMED UNCANNY AND FATEFUL OFTEN FAR AWAY THERE I THOUGHT 
OF THESE TWO GUARDING THE DOOR OF DARKNESS KNITTING BLACK WOOL AS FOR 
A WARM PALL ONE INTRODUCING INTRODUCING CONTINUOUSLY TO THE UNKNOWN 
THE OTHER SCRUTINIZING THE CHEERY AND FOOLISH FACES WITH UNCONCERNED OLD 
EYES AVE OLD KNITTER OF BLACK WOOL MORITURI TE SALUTANT NOT MANY OF 
THOSE SHE LOOKED AT EVER SAW HER AGAINNOT HALF BY A LONG WAY 
 
THERE WAS YET A VISIT TO THE DOCTOR A SIMPLE FORMALITY ASSURED ME 
THE SECRETARY WITH AN AIR OF TAKING AN IMMENSE PART IN ALL MY SORROWS 
ACCORDINGLY A YOUNG CHAP WEARING HIS HAT OVER THE LEFT EYEBROW SOME 
CLERK I SUPPOSETHERE MUST HAVE BEEN CLERKS IN THE BUSINESS THOUGH 
THE HOUSE WAS AS STILL AS A HOUSE IN A CITY OF THE DEADCAME FROM 
SOMEWHERE UPSTAIRS AND LED ME FORTH HE WAS SHABBY AND CARELESS WITH 
INKSTAINS ON THE SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND HIS CRAVAT WAS LARGE AND 
BILLOWY UNDER A CHIN SHAPED LIKE THE TOE OF AN OLD BOOT IT WAS A 
LITTLE TOO EARLY FOR THE DOCTOR SO I PROPOSED A DRINK AND THEREUPON HE 
DEVELOPED A VEIN OF JOVIALITY AS WE SAT OVER OUR VERMOUTHS HE GLORIFIED 
THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND BYANDBY I EXPRESSED CASUALLY MY SURPRISE 
AT HIM NOT GOING OUT THERE HE BECAME VERY COOL AND COLLECTED ALL AT 
ONCE I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS I LOOK QUOTH PLATO TO HIS DISCIPLES 
HE SAID SENTENTIOUSLY EMPTIED HIS GLASS WITH GREAT RESOLUTION AND WE 
ROSE 
 
THE OLD DOCTOR FELT MY PULSE EVIDENTLY THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE 
THE WHILE GOOD GOOD FOR THERE HE MUMBLED AND THEN WITH A CERTAIN 
EAGERNESS ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD LET HIM MEASURE MY HEAD RATHER 
SURPRISED I SAID YES WHEN HE PRODUCED A THING LIKE CALIPERS AND GOT 
THE DIMENSIONS BACK AND FRONT AND EVERY WAY TAKING NOTES CAREFULLY HE 
WAS AN UNSHAVEN LITTLE MAN IN A THREADBARE COAT LIKE A GABERDINE WITH 
HIS FEET IN SLIPPERS AND I THOUGHT HIM A HARMLESS FOOL I ALWAYS ASK 
LEAVE IN THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE TO MEASURE THE CRANIA OF THOSE GOING 
OUT THERE HE SAID AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TOO I ASKED OH I 
NEVER SEE THEM HE REMARKED AND MOREOVER THE CHANGES TAKE PLACE 
INSIDE YOU KNOW HE SMILED AS IF AT SOME QUIET JOKE SO YOU ARE 
GOING OUT THERE FAMOUS INTERESTING TOO HE GAVE ME A SEARCHING 
GLANCE AND MADE ANOTHER NOTE EVER ANY MADNESS IN YOUR FAMILY HE 
ASKED IN A MATTEROFFACT TONE I FELT VERY ANNOYED IS THAT QUESTION 
IN THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE TOO IT WOULD BE HE SAID WITHOUT TAKING 
NOTICE OF MY IRRITATION INTERESTING FOR SCIENCE TO WATCH THE MENTAL 
CHANGES OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE SPOT BUT    ARE YOU AN ALIENIST I 
INTERRUPTED EVERY DOCTOR SHOULD BEA LITTLE ANSWERED THAT ORIGINAL 
IMPERTURBABLY I HAVE A LITTLE THEORY WHICH YOU MESSIEURS WHO GO OUT 
THERE MUST HELP ME TO PROVE THIS IS MY SHARE IN THE ADVANTAGES MY 
COUNTRY SHALL REAP FROM THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT DEPENDENCY 
THE MERE WEALTH I LEAVE TO OTHERS PARDON MY QUESTIONS BUT YOU ARE 
THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN COMING UNDER MY OBSERVATION    I HASTENED 
TO ASSURE HIM I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST TYPICAL IF I WERE SAID I 
I WOULDNT BE TALKING LIKE THIS WITH YOU WHAT YOU SAY IS RATHER 
PROFOUND AND PROBABLY ERRONEOUS HE SAID WITH A LAUGH AVOID 
IRRITATION MORE THAN EXPOSURE TO THE SUN ADIEU HOW DO YOU ENGLISH 
SAY EH GOODBY AH GOODBY ADIEU IN THE TROPICS ONE MUST BEFORE 
EVERYTHING KEEP CALM    HE LIFTED A WARNING FOREFINGER    DU 
CALME DU CALME ADIEU 
 
ONE THING MORE REMAINED TO DOSAY GOODBY TO MY EXCELLENT AUNT I 
FOUND HER TRIUMPHANT I HAD A CUP OF TEATHE LAST DECENT CUP OF TEA FOR 
MANY DAYSAND IN A ROOM THAT MOST SOOTHINGLY LOOKED JUST AS YOU WOULD 
EXPECT A LADYS DRAWINGROOM TO LOOK WE HAD A LONG QUIET CHAT BY THE 
FIRESIDE IN THE COURSE OF THESE CONFIDENCES IT BECAME QUITE PLAIN TO ME 
I HAD BEEN REPRESENTED TO THE WIFE OF THE HIGH DIGNITARY AND GOODNESS 
KNOWS TO HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE BESIDES AS AN EXCEPTIONAL AND GIFTED 
CREATUREA PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE FOR THE COMPANYA MAN YOU DONT GET 
HOLD OF EVERY DAY GOOD HEAVENS AND I WAS GOING TO TAKE CHARGE OF A

OF APOSTLE THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF SUCH ROT LET LOOSE IN PRINT AND TALK 
JUST ABOUT THAT TIME AND THE EXCELLENT WOMAN LIVING RIGHT IN THE RUSH 
OF ALL THAT HUMBUG GOT CARRIED OFF HER FEET SHE TALKED ABOUT WEANING 
THOSE IGNORANT MILLIONS FROM THEIR HORRID WAYS TILL UPON MY WORD SHE 
MADE ME QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE I VENTURED TO HINT THAT THE COMPANY WAS RUN 
FOR PROFIT 
 
YOU FORGET DEAR CHARLIE THAT THE LABORER IS WORTHY OF HIS HIRE SHE 
SAID BRIGHTLY ITS QUEER HOW OUT OF TOUCH WITH TRUTH WOMEN ARE THEY 
LIVE IN A WORLD OF THEIR OWN AND THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
AND NEVER CAN BE IT IS TOO BEAUTIFUL ALTOGETHER AND IF THEY WERE TO 
SET IT UP IT WOULD GO TO PIECES BEFORE THE FIRST SUNSET SOME CONFOUNDED 
FACT WE MEN HAVE BEEN LIVING CONTENTEDLY WITH EVER SINCE THE DAY OF 
CREATION WOULD START UP AND KNOCK THE WHOLE THING OVER 
 
AFTER THIS I GOT EMBRACED TOLD TO WEAR FLANNEL BE SURE TO WRITE 
OFTEN AND SO ONAND I LEFT IN THE STREETI DONT KNOW WHYA QUEER 
FEELING CAME TO ME THAT I WAS AN IMPOSTOR ODD THING THAT I WHO USED TO 
CLEAR OUT FOR ANY PART OF THE WORLD AT TWENTYFOUR HOURS NOTICE WITH 
LESS THOUGHT THAN MOST MEN GIVE TO THE CROSSING OF A STREET HAD A 
MOMENTI WONT SAY OF HESITATION BUT OF STARTLED PAUSE BEFORE THIS 
COMMONPLACE AFFAIR THE BEST WAY I CAN EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IS BY SAYING 
THAT FOR A SECOND OR TWO I FELT AS THOUGH INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE 
CENTER OF A CONTINENT I WERE ABOUT TO SET OFF FOR THE CENTER OF THE 
EARTH 
 
I LEFT IN A FRENCH STEAMER AND SHE CALLED IN EVERY BLAMED PORT THEY 
HAVE OUT THERE FOR AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE SOLE PURPOSE OF LANDING 
SOLDIERS AND CUSTOMHOUSE OFFICERS I WATCHED THE COAST WATCHING A 
COAST AS IT SLIPS BY THE SHIP IS LIKE THINKING ABOUT AN ENIGMA THERE 
IT IS BEFORE YOUSMILING FROWNING INVITING GRAND MEAN INSIPID OR 
SAVAGE AND ALWAYS MUTE WITH AN AIR OF WHISPERING COME AND FIND OUT 
THIS ONE WAS ALMOST FEATURELESS AS IF STILL IN THE MAKING WITH 
AN ASPECT OF MONOTONOUS GRIMNESS THE EDGE OF A COLOSSAL JUNGLE SO 
DARKGREEN AS TO BE ALMOST BLACK FRINGED WITH WHITE SURF RAN STRAIGHT 
LIKE A RULED LINE FAR FAR AWAY ALONG A BLUE SEA WHOSE GLITTER WAS 
BLURRED BY A CREEPING MIST THE SUN WAS FIERCE THE LAND SEEMED TO 
GLISTEN AND DRIP WITH STEAM HERE AND THERE GRAYISHWHITISH SPECKS 
SHOWED UP CLUSTERED INSIDE THE WHITE SURF WITH A FLAG FLYING ABOVE 
THEM PERHAPS SETTLEMENTS SOME CENTURIES OLD AND STILL NO BIGGER THAN 
PINHEADS ON THE UNTOUCHED EXPANSE OF THEIR BACKGROUND WE POUNDED 
ALONG STOPPED LANDED SOLDIERS WENT ON LANDED CUSTOMHOUSE CLERKS TO 
LEVY TOLL IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GODFORSAKEN WILDERNESS WITH A TIN SHED 
AND A FLAGPOLE LOST IN IT LANDED MORE SOLDIERSTO TAKE CARE OF THE 
CUSTOMHOUSE CLERKS PRESUMABLY SOME I HEARD GOT DROWNED IN THE SURF 
BUT WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT NOBODY SEEMED PARTICULARLY TO CARE THEY 
WERE JUST FLUNG OUT THERE AND ON WE WENT EVERY DAY THE COAST 
LOOKED THE SAME AS THOUGH WE HAD NOT MOVED BUT WE PASSED VARIOUS 
PLACESTRADING PLACESWITH NAMES LIKE GRAN BASSAM LITTLE POPO NAMES 
THAT SEEMED TO BELONG TO SOME SORDID FARCE ACTED IN FRONT OF A SINISTER 
BACKCLOTH THE IDLENESS OF A PASSENGER MY ISOLATION AMONGST ALL THESE 
MEN WITH WHOM I HAD NO POINT OF CONTACT THE OILY AND LANGUID SEA THE 
UNIFORM SOMBERNESS OF THE COAST SEEMED TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM THE TRUTH 
OF THINGS WITHIN THE TOIL OF A MOURNFUL AND SENSELESS DELUSION THE 
VOICE OF THE SURF HEARD NOW AND THEN WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE LIKE THE 
SPEECH OF A BROTHER IT WAS SOMETHING NATURAL THAT HAD ITS REASON THAT 
HAD A MEANING NOW AND THEN A BOAT FROM THE SHORE GAVE ONE A MOMENTARY 
CONTACT WITH REALITY IT WAS PADDLED BY BLACK FELLOWS YOU COULD SEE 
FROM AFAR THE WHITE OF THEIR EYEBALLS GLISTENING THEY SHOUTED SANG 
THEIR BODIES STREAMED WITH PERSPIRATION THEY HAD FACES LIKE GROTESQUE 
MASKSTHESE CHAPS BUT THEY HAD BONE MUSCLE A WILD VITALITY AN 
INTENSE ENERGY OF MOVEMENT THAT WAS AS NATURAL AND TRUE AS THE SURF 
ALONG THEIR COAST THEY WANTED NO EXCUSE FOR BEING THERE THEY WERE A 
GREAT COMFORT TO LOOK AT FOR A TIME I WOULD FEEL I BELONGED STILL TO 
A WORLD OF STRAIGHTFORWARD FACTS BUT THE FEELING WOULD NOT LAST LONG 
SOMETHING WOULD TURN UP TO SCARE IT AWAY ONCE I REMEMBER WE CAME UPON 
A MANOFWAR ANCHORED OFF THE COAST THERE WASNT EVEN A SHED THERE AND 
SHE WAS SHELLING THE BUSH IT APPEARS THE FRENCH HAD ONE OF THEIR WARS 
GOING ON THEREABOUTS HER ENSIGN DROPPED LIMP LIKE A RAG THE MUZZLES 
OF THE LONG EIGHTINCH GUNS STUCK OUT ALL OVER THE LOW HULL THE GREASY 
SLIMY SWELL SWUNG HER UP LAZILY AND LET HER DOWN SWAYING HER THIN 
MASTS IN THE EMPTY IMMENSITY OF EARTH SKY AND WATER THERE SHE WAS 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE FIRING INTO A CONTINENT POP WOULD GO ONE OF THE 
EIGHTINCH GUNS A SMALL FLAME WOULD DART AND VANISH A LITTLE 
WHITE SMOKE WOULD DISAPPEAR A TINY PROJECTILE WOULD GIVE A FEEBLE 
SCREECHAND NOTHING HAPPENED NOTHING COULD HAPPEN THERE WAS A TOUCH 
OF INSANITY IN THE PROCEEDING A SENSE OF LUGUBRIOUS DROLLERY IN THE 
SIGHT AND IT WAS NOT DISSIPATED BY SOMEBODY ON BOARD ASSURING ME 
EARNESTLY THERE WAS A CAMP OF NATIVESHE CALLED THEM ENEMIESHIDDEN 
OUT OF SIGHT SOMEWHERE 
 
WE GAVE HER HER LETTERS I HEARD THE MEN IN THAT LONELY SHIP WERE DYING 
OF FEVER AT THE RATE OF THREE A DAY AND WENT ON WE CALLED AT SOME MORE 
PLACES WITH FARCICAL NAMES WHERE THE MERRY DANCE OF DEATH AND TRADE 
GOES ON IN A STILL AND EARTHY ATMOSPHERE AS OF AN OVERHEATED CATACOMB 
ALL ALONG THE FORMLESS COAST BORDERED BY DANGEROUS SURF AS IF NATURE 
HERSELF HAD TRIED TO WARD OFF INTRUDERS IN AND OUT OF RIVERS STREAMS 
OF DEATH IN LIFE WHOSE BANKS WERE ROTTING INTO MUD WHOSE WATERS 
THICKENED INTO SLIME INVADED THE CONTORTED MANGROVES THAT SEEMED TO 
WRITHE AT US IN THE EXTREMITY OF AN IMPOTENT DESPAIR NOWHERE DID WE 
STOP LONG ENOUGH TO GET A PARTICULARIZED IMPRESSION BUT THE GENERAL 
SENSE OF VAGUE AND OPPRESSIVE WONDER GREW UPON ME IT WAS LIKE A WEARY 
PILGRIMAGE AMONGST HINTS FOR NIGHTMARES 
 
IT WAS UPWARD OF THIRTY DAYS BEFORE I SAW THE MOUTH OF THE BIG RIVER 
WE ANCHORED OFF THE SEAT OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT MY WORK WOULD NOT BEGIN 
TILL SOME TWO HUNDRED MILES FARTHER ON SO AS SOON AS I COULD I MADE A 
START FOR A PLACE THIRTY MILES HIGHER UP 
 
I HAD MY PASSAGE ON A LITTLE SEAGOING STEAMER HER CAPTAIN WAS A 
SWEDE AND KNOWING ME FOR A SEAMAN INVITED ME ON THE BRIDGE HE WAS A 
YOUNG MAN LEAN FAIR AND MOROSE WITH LANKY HAIR AND A SHUFFLING GAIT 
AS WE LEFT THE MISERABLE LITTLE WHARF HE TOSSED HIS HEAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY 
AT THE SHORE BEEN LIVING THERE HE ASKED I SAID YES FINE LOT 
THESE GOVERNMENT CHAPSARE THEY NOT HE WENT ON SPEAKING ENGLISH 
WITH GREAT PRECISION AND CONSIDERABLE BITTERNESS IT IS FUNNY WHAT SOME 
PEOPLE WILL DO FOR A FEW FRANCS A MONTH I WONDER WHAT BECOMES OF THAT 
KIND WHEN IT GOES UP COUNTRY I SAID TO HIM I EXPECTED TO SEE THAT 
SOON SOOO HE EXCLAIMED HE SHUFFLED ATHWART KEEPING ONE EYE AHEAD 
VIGILANTLY DONT BE TOO SURE HE CONTINUED THE OTHER DAY I TOOK 
UP A MAN WHO HANGED HIMSELF ON THE ROAD HE WAS A SWEDE TOO 
HANGED HIMSELF WHY IN GODS NAME I CRIED HE KEPT ON LOOKING 
OUT WATCHFULLY WHO KNOWS THE SUN TOO MUCH FOR HIM OR THE COUNTRY 
PERHAPS 
 
AT LAST WE OPENED A REACH A ROCKY CLIFF APPEARED MOUNDS OF TURNEDUP 
EARTH BY THE SHORE HOUSES ON A HILL OTHERS WITH IRON ROOFS AMONGST A 
WASTE OF EXCAVATIONS OR HANGING TO THE DECLIVITY A CONTINUOUS NOISE OF 
THE RAPIDS ABOVE HOVERED OVER THIS SCENE OF INHABITED DEVASTATION A 
LOT OF PEOPLE MOSTLY BLACK AND NAKED MOVED ABOUT LIKE ANTS A JETTY 
PROJECTED INTO THE RIVER A BLINDING SUNLIGHT DROWNED ALL THIS AT TIMES 
IN A SUDDEN RECRUDESCENCE OF GLARE THERES YOUR COMPANYS STATION 
SAID THE SWEDE POINTING TO THREE WOODEN BARRACKLIKE STRUCTURES ON THE 
ROCKY SLOPE I WILL SEND YOUR THINGS UP FOUR BOXES DID YOU SAY SO 
FAREWELL 
 
I CAME UPON A BOILER WALLOWING IN THE GRASS THEN FOUND A PATH 
LEADING UP THE HILL IT TURNED ASIDE FOR THE BOWLDERS AND ALSO FOR AN 
UNDERSIZED RAILWAYTRUCK LYING THERE ON ITS BACK WITH ITS WHEELS IN 
THE AIR ONE WAS OFF THE THING LOOKED AS DEAD AS THE CARCASS OF SOME 
ANIMAL I CAME UPON MORE PIECES OF DECAYING MACHINERY A STACK OF RUSTY 
RAILS TO THE LEFT A CLUMP OF TREES MADE A SHADY SPOT WHERE DARK THINGS 
SEEMED TO STIR FEEBLY I BLINKED THE PATH WAS STEEP A HORN TOOTED TO 
THE RIGHT AND I SAW THE BLACK PEOPLE RUN A HEAVY AND DULL DETONATION 
SHOOK THE GROUND A PUFF OF SMOKE CAME OUT OF THE CLIFF AND THAT WAS 
ALL NO CHANGE APPEARED ON THE FACE OF THE ROCK THEY WERE BUILDING A 
RAILWAY THE CLIFF WAS NOT IN THE WAY OR ANYTHING BUT THIS OBJECTLESS 
BLASTING WAS ALL THE WORK GOING ON 
 
A SLIGHT CLINKING BEHIND ME MADE ME TURN MY HEAD SIX BLACK MEN 
ADVANCED IN A FILE TOILING UP THE PATH THEY WALKED ERECT AND SLOW 
BALANCING SMALL BASKETS FULL OF EARTH ON THEIR HEADS AND THE CLINK KEPT 
TIME WITH THEIR FOOTSTEPS BLACK RAGS WERE WOUND ROUND THEIR LOINS AND 
THE SHORT ENDS BEHIND WAGGED TO AND FRO LIKE TAILS I COULD SEE EVERY 
RIB THE JOINTS OF THEIR LIMBS WERE LIKE KNOTS IN A ROPE EACH HAD AN 
IRON COLLAR ON HIS NECK AND ALL WERE CONNECTED TOGETHER WITH A CHAIN 
WHOSE BIGHTS SWUNG BETWEEN THEM RHYTHMICALLY CLINKING ANOTHER REPORT 
FROM THE CLIFF MADE ME THINK SUDDENLY OF THAT SHIP OF WAR I HAD SEEN 
FIRING INTO A CONTINENT IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF OMINOUS VOICE BUT 
THESE MEN COULD BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION BE CALLED ENEMIES THEY 
WERE CALLED CRIMINALS AND THE OUTRAGED LAW LIKE THE BURSTING SHELLS 
HAD COME TO THEM AN INSOLUBLE MYSTERY FROM OVER THE SEA ALL THEIR 
MEAGER BREASTS PANTED TOGETHER THE VIOLENTLY DILATED NOSTRILS QUIVERED 
THE EYES STARED STONILY UPHILL THEY PASSED ME WITHIN SIX INCHES 
WITHOUT A GLANCE WITH THAT COMPLETE DEATHLIKE INDIFFERENCE OF UNHAPPY 
SAVAGES BEHIND THIS RAW MATTER ONE OF THE RECLAIMED THE PRODUCT OF 
THE NEW FORCES AT WORK STROLLED DESPONDENTLY CARRYING A RIFLE BY ITS 
MIDDLE HE HAD A UNIFORM JACKET WITH ONE BUTTON OFF AND SEEING A WHITE 
MAN ON THE PATH HOISTED HIS WEAPON TO HIS SHOULDER WITH ALACRITY THIS 
WAS SIMPLE PRUDENCE WHITE MEN BEING SO MUCH ALIKE AT A DISTANCE THAT 
HE COULD NOT TELL WHO I MIGHT BE HE WAS SPEEDILY REASSURED AND WITH A 
LARGE WHITE RASCALLY GRIN AND A GLANCE AT HIS CHARGE SEEMED TO TAKE 
ME INTO PARTNERSHIP IN HIS EXALTED TRUST AFTER ALL I ALSO WAS A PART 
OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF THESE HIGH AND JUST PROCEEDINGS 
 
INSTEAD OF GOING UP I TURNED AND DESCENDED TO THE LEFT MY IDEA WAS TO 
LET THAT CHAINGANG GET OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE I CLIMBED THE HILL YOU KNOW 
I AM NOT PARTICULARLY TENDER IVE HAD TO STRIKE AND TO FEND OFF 
IVE HAD TO RESIST AND TO ATTACK SOMETIMESTHATS ONLY ONE WAY OF 
RESISTINGWITHOUT COUNTING THE EXACT COST ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS 
OF SUCH SORT OF LIFE AS I HAD BLUNDERED INTO IVE SEEN THE DEVIL OF 
VIOLENCE AND THE DEVIL OF GREED AND THE DEVIL OF HOT DESIRE BUT BY 
ALL THE STARS THESE WERE STRONG LUSTY REDEYED DEVILS THAT SWAYED 
AND DROVE MENMEN I TELL YOU BUT AS I STOOD ON THIS HILLSIDE I 
FORESAW THAT IN THE BLINDING SUNSHINE OF THAT LAND I WOULD BECOME 
ACQUAINTED WITH A FLABBY PRETENDING WEAKEYED DEVIL OF A RAPACIOUS AND 
PITILESS FOLLY HOW INSIDIOUS HE COULD BE TOO I WAS ONLY TO FIND OUT 
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AND A THOUSAND MILES FARTHER FOR A MOMENT I 
STOOD APPALLED AS THOUGH BY A WARNING FINALLY I DESCENDED THE HILL 
OBLIQUELY TOWARDS THE TREES I HAD SEEN 
 
I AVOIDED A VAST ARTIFICIAL HOLE SOMEBODY HAD BEEN DIGGING ON THE 
SLOPE THE PURPOSE OF WHICH I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVINE IT WASNT 
A QUARRY OR A SANDPIT ANYHOW IT WAS JUST A HOLE IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC DESIRE OF GIVING THE CRIMINALS 
SOMETHING TO DO I DONT KNOW THEN I NEARLY FELL INTO A VERY NARROW 
RAVINE ALMOST NO MORE THAN A SCAR IN THE HILLSIDE I DISCOVERED THAT 
A LOT OF IMPORTED DRAINAGEPIPES FOR THE SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN TUMBLED IN 
THERE THERE WASNT ONE THAT WAS NOT BROKEN IT WAS A WANTON SMASHUP 
AT LAST I GOT UNDER THE TREES MY PURPOSE WAS TO STROLL INTO THE SHADE 
FOR A MOMENT BUT NO SOONER WITHIN THAN IT SEEMED TO ME I HAD STEPPED 
INTO A GLOOMY CIRCLE OF SOME INFERNO THE RAPIDS WERE NEAR AND AN 
UNINTERRUPTED UNIFORM HEADLONG RUSHING NOISE FILLED THE MOURNFUL 
STILLNESS OF THE GROVE WHERE NOT A BREATH STIRRED NOT A LEAF MOVED 
WITH A MYSTERIOUS SOUNDAS THOUGH THE TEARING PACE OF THE LAUNCHED 
EARTH HAD SUDDENLY BECOME AUDIBLE 
 
BLACK SHAPES CROUCHED LAY SAT BETWEEN THE TREES LEANING AGAINST THE 
TRUNKS CLINGING TO THE EARTH HALF COMING OUT HALF EFFACED WITHIN 
THE DIM LIGHT IN ALL THE ATTITUDES OF PAIN ABANDONMENT AND DESPAIR 
ANOTHER MINE ON THE CLIFF WENT OFF FOLLOWED BY A SLIGHT SHUDDER OF THE 
SOIL UNDER MY FEET THE WORK WAS GOING ON THE WORK AND THIS WAS THE 
PLACE WHERE SOME OF THE HELPERS HAD WITHDRAWN TO DIE 
 
THEY WERE DYING SLOWLYIT WAS VERY CLEAR THEY WERE NOT ENEMIES THEY 
WERE NOT CRIMINALS THEY WERE NOTHING EARTHLY NOWNOTHING BUT BLACK 
SHADOWS OF DISEASE AND STARVATION LYING CONFUSEDLY IN THE GREENISH 
GLOOM BROUGHT FROM ALL THE RECESSES OF THE COAST IN ALL THE LEGALITY 
OF TIME CONTRACTS LOST IN UNCONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS FED ON UNFAMILIAR 
FOOD THEY SICKENED BECAME INEFFICIENT AND WERE THEN ALLOWED TO CRAWL 
AWAY AND REST THESE MORIBUND SHAPES WERE FREE AS AIRAND NEARLY AS 
THIN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH THE GLEAM OF EYES UNDER THE TREES THEN 
GLANCING DOWN I SAW A FACE NEAR MY HAND THE BLACK BONES RECLINED AT 
FULL LENGTH WITH ONE SHOULDER AGAINST THE TREE AND SLOWLY THE EYELIDS 
ROSE AND THE SUNKEN EYES LOOKED UP AT ME ENORMOUS AND VACANT A KIND OF 
BLIND WHITE FLICKER IN THE DEPTHS OF THE ORBS WHICH DIED OUT SLOWLY 
THE MAN SEEMED YOUNGALMOST A BOYBUT YOU KNOW WITH THEM ITS HARD TO 
TELL I FOUND NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT TO OFFER HIM ONE OF MY GOOD SWEDES 
SHIPS BISCUITS I HAD IN MY POCKET THE FINGERS CLOSED SLOWLY ON IT AND 
HELDTHERE WAS NO OTHER MOVEMENT AND NO OTHER GLANCE HE HAD TIED A 
BIT OF WHITE WORSTED ROUND HIS NECKWHY WHERE DID HE GET IT WAS IT A 
BADGEAN ORNAMENTA CHARMA PROPITIATORY ACT WAS THERE ANY IDEA AT 
ALL CONNECTED WITH IT IT LOOKED STARTLING ROUND HIS BLACK NECK THIS 
BIT OF WHITE THREAD FROM BEYOND THE SEAS 
 
NEAR THE SAME TREE TWO MORE BUNDLES OF ACUTE ANGLES SAT WITH THEIR LEGS 
DRAWN UP ONE WITH HIS CHIN PROPPED ON HIS KNEES STARED AT NOTHING 
IN AN INTOLERABLE AND APPALLING MANNER HIS BROTHER PHANTOM RESTED ITS 
FOREHEAD AS IF OVERCOME WITH A GREAT WEARINESS AND ALL ABOUT OTHERS 
WERE SCATTERED IN EVERY POSE OF CONTORTED COLLAPSE AS IN SOME PICTURE 
OF A MASSACRE OR A PESTILENCE WHILE I STOOD HORRORSTRUCK ONE OF THESE 
CREATURES ROSE TO HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND WENT OFF ON ALLFOURS TOWARDS 
THE RIVER TO DRINK HE LAPPED OUT OF HIS HAND THEN SAT UP IN THE 
SUNLIGHT CROSSING HIS SHINS IN FRONT OF HIM AND AFTER A TIME LET HIS 
WOOLLY HEAD FALL ON HIS BREASTBONE 
 
I DIDNT WANT ANY MORE LOITERING IN THE SHADE AND I MADE HASTE TOWARDS 
THE STATION WHEN NEAR THE BUILDINGS I MET A WHITE MAN IN SUCH AN 
UNEXPECTED ELEGANCE OF GETUP THAT IN THE FIRST MOMENT I TOOK HIM FOR 
A SORT OF VISION I SAW A HIGH STARCHED COLLAR WHITE CUFFS A LIGHT 
ALPACA JACKET SNOWY TROUSERS A CLEAR NECKTIE AND VARNISHED BOOTS NO 
HAT HAIR PARTED BRUSHED OILED UNDER A GREENLINED PARASOL HELD IN A 
BIG WHITE HAND HE WAS AMAZING AND HAD A PENHOLDER BEHIND HIS EAR 
 
I SHOOK HANDS WITH THIS MIRACLE AND I LEARNED HE WAS THE COMPANYS 
CHIEF ACCOUNTANT AND THAT ALL THE BOOKKEEPING WAS DONE AT THIS STATION 
HE HAD COME OUT FOR A MOMENT HE SAID TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
THE EXPRESSION SOUNDED WONDERFULLY ODD WITH ITS SUGGESTION OF SEDENTARY 
DESKLIFE I WOULDNT HAVE MENTIONED THE FELLOW TO YOU AT ALL ONLY 
IT WAS FROM HIS LIPS THAT I FIRST HEARD THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO IS 
SO INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTED WITH THE MEMORIES OF THAT TIME MOREOVER I 
RESPECTED THE FELLOW YES I RESPECTED HIS COLLARS HIS VAST CUFFS 
HIS BRUSHED HAIR HIS APPEARANCE WAS CERTAINLY THAT OF A HAIRDRESSERS 
DUMMY BUT IN THE GREAT DEMORALIZATION OF THE LAND HE KEPT UP 
HIS APPEARANCE THATS BACKBONE HIS STARCHED COLLARS AND GOTUP 
SHIRTFRONTS WERE ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHARACTER HE HAD BEEN OUT NEARLY 
THREE YEARS AND LATER ON I COULD NOT HELP ASKING HIM HOW HE MANAGED 
TO SPORT SUCH LINEN HE HAD JUST THE FAINTEST BLUSH AND SAID MODESTLY 
IVE BEEN TEACHING ONE OF THE NATIVE WOMEN ABOUT THE STATION IT 
WAS DIFFICULT SHE HAD A DISTASTE FOR THE WORK THIS MAN HAD VERILY 
ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING AND HE WAS DEVOTED TO HIS BOOKS WHICH WERE IN 
APPLEPIE ORDER 
 
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE STATION WAS IN A MUDDLEHEADS THINGS 
BUILDINGS STRINGS OF DUSTY NIGGERS WITH SPLAY FEET ARRIVED AND 
DEPARTED A STREAM OF MANUFACTURED GOODS RUBBISHY COTTONS BEADS 
AND BRASSWIRE SET INTO THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS AND IN RETURN CAME A 
PRECIOUS TRICKLE OF IVORY 
 
I HAD TO WAIT IN THE STATION FOR TEN DAYSAN ETERNITY I LIVED IN A 
HUT IN THE YARD BUT TO BE OUT OF THE CHAOS I WOULD SOMETIMES GET INTO 
THE ACCOUNTANTS OFFICE IT WAS BUILT OF HORIZONTAL PLANKS AND SO BADLY 
PUT TOGETHER THAT AS HE BENT OVER HIS HIGH DESK HE WAS BARRED FROM 
NECK TO HEELS WITH NARROW STRIPS OF SUNLIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED TO 
OPEN THE BIG SHUTTER TO SEE IT WAS HOT THERE TOO BIG FLIES BUZZED 
FIENDISHLY AND DID NOT STING BUT STABBED I SAT GENERALLY ON THE 
FLOOR WHILE OF FAULTLESS APPEARANCE AND EVEN SLIGHTLY SCENTED 
PERCHING ON A HIGH STOOL HE WROTE HE WROTE SOMETIMES HE STOOD UP FOR 
EXERCISE WHEN A TRUCKLEBED WITH A SICK MAN SOME INVALIDED AGENT FROM 
UPCOUNTRY WAS PUT IN THERE HE EXHIBITED A GENTLE ANNOYANCE THE 
GROANS OF THIS SICK PERSON HE SAID DISTRACT MY ATTENTION AND WITHOUT 
THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GUARD AGAINST CLERICAL ERRORS IN THIS 
CLIMATE 
 
ONE DAY HE REMARKED WITHOUT LIFTING HIS HEAD IN THE INTERIOR YOU 
WILL NO DOUBT MEET MR KURTZ ON MY ASKING WHO MR KURTZ WAS HE 
SAID HE WAS A FIRSTCLASS AGENT AND SEEING MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT 
THIS INFORMATION HE ADDED SLOWLY LAYING DOWN HIS PEN HE IS A VERY 
REMARKABLE PERSON FURTHER QUESTIONS ELICITED FROM HIM THAT MR KURTZ 
WAS AT PRESENT IN CHARGE OF A TRADING POST A VERY IMPORTANT ONE IN THE 
TRUE IVORYCOUNTRY AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THERE SENDS IN AS MUCH IVORY 
AS ALL THE OTHERS PUT TOGETHER    HE BEGAN TO WRITE AGAIN THE SICK 
MAN WAS TOO ILL TO GROAN THE FLIES BUZZED IN A GREAT PEACE 
 
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GROWING MURMUR OF VOICES AND A GREAT TRAMPING OF 
FEET A CARAVAN HAD COME IN A VIOLENT BABBLE OF UNCOUTH SOUNDS BURST 
OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANKS ALL THE CARRIERS WERE SPEAKING 
TOGETHER AND IN THE MIDST OF THE UPROAR THE LAMENTABLE VOICE OF THE 
CHIEF AGENT WAS HEARD GIVING IT UP TEARFULLY FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME 
THAT DAY    HE ROSE SLOWLY WHAT A FRIGHTFUL ROW HE SAID HE 
CROSSED THE ROOM GENTLY TO LOOK AT THE SICK MAN AND RETURNING SAID TO 
ME HE DOES NOT HEAR WHAT DEAD I ASKED STARTLED NO NOT YET 
HE ANSWERED WITH GREAT COMPOSURE THEN ALLUDING WITH A TOSS OF THE 
HEAD TO THE TUMULT IN THE STATIONYARD WHEN ONE HAS GOT TO MAKE 
CORRECT ENTRIES ONE COMES TO HATE THOSE SAVAGESHATE THEM TO THE 
DEATH HE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT WHEN YOU SEE MR KURTZ 
HE WENT ON TELL HIM FROM ME THAT EVERYTHING HEREHE GLANCED AT THE 
DESKIS VERY SATISFACTORY I DONT LIKE TO WRITE TO HIMWITH THOSE 
MESSENGERS OF OURS YOU NEVER KNOW WHO MAY GET HOLD OF YOUR LETTERAT 
THAT CENTRAL STATION HE STARED AT ME FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS MILD 
BULGING EYES OH HE WILL GO FAR VERY FAR HE BEGAN AGAIN HE 
WILL BE A SOMEBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE LONG THEY ABOVETHE 
COUNCIL IN EUROPE YOU KNOWMEAN HIM TO BE 
 
HE TURNED TO HIS WORK THE NOISE OUTSIDE HAD CEASED AND PRESENTLY 
IN GOING OUT I STOPPED AT THE DOOR IN THE STEADY BUZZ OF FLIES THE 
HOMEWARDBOUND AGENT WAS LYING FLUSHED AND INSENSIBLE THE OTHER 
BENT OVER HIS BOOKS WAS MAKING CORRECT ENTRIES OF PERFECTLY CORRECT 
TRANSACTIONS AND FIFTY FEET BELOW THE DOORSTEP I COULD SEE THE STILL 
TREETOPS OF THE GROVE OF DEATH 
 
NEXT DAY I LEFT THAT STATION AT LAST WITH A CARAVAN OF SIXTY MEN FOR 
A TWOHUNDREDMILE TRAMP 
 
NO USE TELLING YOU MUCH ABOUT THAT PATHS PATHS EVERYWHERE A 
STAMPEDIN NETWORK OF PATHS SPREADING OVER THE EMPTY LAND THROUGH 
LONG GRASS THROUGH BURNT GRASS THROUGH THICKETS DOWN AND UP CHILLY 
RAVINES UP AND DOWN STONY HILLS ABLAZE WITH HEAT AND A SOLITUDE A 
SOLITUDE NOBODY NOT A HUT THE POPULATION HAD CLEARED OUT A LONG 
TIME AGO WELL IF A LOT OF MYSTERIOUS NIGGERS ARMED WITH ALL KINDS OF 
FEARFUL WEAPONS SUDDENLY TOOK TO TRAVELING ON THE ROAD BETWEEN DEAL AND 
GRAVESEND CATCHING THE YOKELS RIGHT AND LEFT TO CARRY HEAVY LOADS FOR 
THEM I FANCY EVERY FARM AND COTTAGE THEREABOUTS WOULD GET EMPTY VERY 
SOON ONLY HERE THE DWELLINGS WERE GONE TOO STILL I PASSED THROUGH 
SEVERAL ABANDONED VILLAGES THERES SOMETHING PATHETICALLY CHILDISH IN 
THE RUINS OF GRASS WALLS DAY AFTER DAY WITH THE STAMP AND SHUFFLE OF 
SIXTY PAIR OF BARE FEET BEHIND ME EACH PAIR UNDER A LB LOAD CAMP 
COOK SLEEP STRIKE CAMP MARCH NOW AND THEN A CARRIER DEAD IN HARNESS 
AT REST IN THE LONG GRASS NEAR THE PATH WITH AN EMPTY WATERGOURD AND 
HIS LONG STAFF LYING BY HIS SIDE A GREAT SILENCE AROUND AND ABOVE 
PERHAPS ON SOME QUIET NIGHT THE TREMOR OF FAROFF DRUMS SINKING 
SWELLING A TREMOR VAST FAINT A SOUND WEIRD APPEALING SUGGESTIVE 
AND WILDAND PERHAPS WITH AS PROFOUND A MEANING AS THE SOUND OF BELLS 
IN A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY ONCE A WHITE MAN IN AN UNBUTTONED UNIFORM 
CAMPING ON THE PATH WITH AN ARMED ESCORT OF LANK ZANZIBARIS VERY 
HOSPITABLE AND FESTIVENOT TO SAY DRUNK WAS LOOKING AFTER THE UPKEEP 
OF THE ROAD HE DECLARED CANT SAY I SAW ANY ROAD OR ANY UPKEEP UNLESS 
THE BODY OF A MIDDLEAGED NEGRO WITH A BULLETHOLE IN THE FOREHEAD 
UPON WHICH I ABSOLUTELY STUMBLED THREE MILES FARTHER ON MAY BE 
CONSIDERED AS A PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT I HAD A WHITE COMPANION TOO NOT 
A BAD CHAP BUT RATHER TOO FLESHY AND WITH THE EXASPERATING HABIT OF 
FAINTING ON THE HOT HILLSIDES MILES AWAY FROM THE LEAST BIT OF SHADE 
AND WATER ANNOYING YOU KNOW TO HOLD YOUR OWN COAT LIKE A PARASOL OVER 
A MANS HEAD WHILE HE IS COMINGTO I COULDNT HELP ASKING HIM ONCE WHAT 
HE MEANT BY COMING THERE AT ALL TO MAKE MONEY OF COURSE WHAT DO YOU 
THINK HE SAID SCORNFULLY THEN HE GOT FEVER AND HAD TO BE CARRIED IN 
A HAMMOCK SLUNG UNDER A POLE AS HE WEIGHED SIXTEEN STONE I HAD NO END 
OF ROWS WITH THE CARRIERS THEY JIBBED RAN AWAY SNEAKED OFF WITH THEIR 
LOADS IN THE NIGHTQUITE A MUTINY SO ONE EVENING I MADE A SPEECH IN 
ENGLISH WITH GESTURES NOT ONE OF WHICH WAS LOST TO THE SIXTY PAIRS OF 
EYES BEFORE ME AND THE NEXT MORNING I STARTED THE HAMMOCK OFF IN FRONT 
ALL RIGHT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS I CAME UPON THE WHOLE CONCERN WRECKED IN 
A BUSHMAN HAMMOCK GROANS BLANKETS HORRORS THE HEAVY POLE HAD 
SKINNED HIS POOR NOSE HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS FOR ME TO KILL SOMEBODY 
BUT THERE WASNT THE SHADOW OF A CARRIER NEAR I REMEMBERED THE OLD 
DOCTORIT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR SCIENCE TO WATCH THE MENTAL 
CHANGES OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE SPOT I FELT I WAS BECOMING 
SCIENTIFICALLY INTERESTING HOWEVER ALL THAT IS TO NO PURPOSE ON THE 
FIFTEENTH DAY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE BIG RIVER AGAIN AND HOBBLED INTO 
THE CENTRAL STATION IT WAS ON A BACK WATER SURROUNDED BY SCRUB AND 
FOREST WITH A PRETTY BORDER OF SMELLY MUD ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE THREE 
OTHERS INCLOSED BY A CRAZY FENCE OF RUSHES A NEGLECTED GAP WAS ALL THE 
GATE IT HAD AND THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE PLACE WAS ENOUGH TO LET YOU SEE 
THE FLABBY DEVIL WAS RUNNING THAT SHOW WHITE MEN WITH LONG STAVES IN 
THEIR HANDS APPEARED LANGUIDLY FROM AMONGST THE BUILDINGS STROLLING UP 
TO TAKE A LOOK AT ME AND THEN RETIRED OUT OF SIGHT SOMEWHERE ONE OF 
THEM A STOUT EXCITABLE CHAP WITH BLACK MUSTACHES INFORMED ME WITH 
GREAT VOLUBILITY AND MANY DIGRESSIONS AS SOON AS I TOLD HIM WHO I WAS 
THAT MY STEAMER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK 
WHAT HOW WHY OH IT WAS ALL RIGHT THE MANAGER HIMSELF WAS THERE 
ALL QUITE CORRECT EVERYBODY HAD BEHAVED SPLENDIDLY SPLENDIDLYYOU 
MUST HE SAID IN AGITATION GO AND SEE THE GENERAL MANAGER AT ONCE HE 
IS WAITING 
 
I DID NOT SEE THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT WRECK AT ONCE I FANCY I 
SEE IT NOW BUT I AM NOT SURENOT AT ALL CERTAINLY THE AFFAIR WAS TOO 
STUPIDWHEN I THINK OF ITTO BE ALTOGETHER NATURAL STILL    BUT 
AT THE MOMENT IT PRESENTED ITSELF SIMPLY AS A CONFOUNDED NUISANCE THE 
STEAMER WAS SUNK THEY HAD STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE IN A SUDDEN HURRY 
UP THE RIVER WITH THE MANAGER ON BOARD IN CHARGE OF SOME VOLUNTEER 
SKIPPER AND BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN OUT THREE HOURS THEY TORE THE BOTTOM 
OUT OF HER ON STONES AND SHE SANK NEAR THE SOUTH BANK I ASKED MYSELF 
WHAT I WAS TO DO THERE NOW MY BOAT WAS LOST AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAD 
PLENTY TO DO IN FISHING MY COMMAND OUT OF THE RIVER I HAD TO SET ABOUT 
IT THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT AND THE REPAIRS WHEN I BROUGHT THE PIECES TO 
THE STATION TOOK SOME MONTHS 
 
MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE MANAGER WAS CURIOUS HE DID NOT ASK ME TO 
SIT DOWN AFTER MY TWENTYMILE WALK THAT MORNING HE WAS COMMONPLACE IN 
COMPLEXION IN FEATURES IN MANNERS AND IN VOICE HE WAS OF MIDDLE 
SIZE AND OF ORDINARY BUILD HIS EYES OF THE USUAL BLUE WERE PERHAPS 
REMARKABLY COLD AND HE CERTAINLY COULD MAKE HIS GLANCE FALL ON ONE AS 
TRENCHANT AND HEAVY AS AN AX BUT EVEN AT THESE TIMES THE REST OF HIS 
PERSON SEEMED TO DISCLAIM THE INTENTION OTHERWISE THERE WAS ONLY 
AN INDEFINABLE FAINT EXPRESSION OF HIS LIPS SOMETHING STEALTHYA 
SMILENOT A SMILEI REMEMBER IT BUT I CANT EXPLAIN IT WAS 
UNCONSCIOUS THIS SMILE WAS THOUGH JUST AFTER HE HAD SAID SOMETHING IT 
GOT INTENSIFIED FOR AN INSTANT IT CAME AT THE END OF HIS SPEECHES LIKE 
A SEAL APPLIED ON THE WORDS TO MAKE THE MEANING OF THE COMMONEST PHRASE 
APPEAR ABSOLUTELY INSCRUTABLE HE WAS A COMMON TRADER FROM HIS YOUTH 
UP EMPLOYED IN THESE PARTSNOTHING MORE HE WAS OBEYED YET HE INSPIRED 
NEITHER LOVE NOR FEAR NOR EVEN RESPECT HE INSPIRED UNEASINESS THAT 
WAS IT UNEASINESS NOT A DEFINITE MISTRUSTJUST UNEASINESSNOTHING 
MORE YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW EFFECTIVE SUCH A    A    FACULTY CAN 
BE HE HAD NO GENIUS FOR ORGANIZING FOR INITIATIVE OR FOR ORDER EVEN 
THAT WAS EVIDENT IN SUCH THINGS AS THE DEPLORABLE STATE OF THE STATION 
HE HAD NO LEARNING AND NO INTELLIGENCE HIS POSITION HAD COME TO 
HIMWHY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS NEVER ILL    HE HAD SERVED THREE 
TERMS OF THREE YEARS OUT THERE    BECAUSE TRIUMPHANT HEALTH IN THE 
GENERAL ROUT OF CONSTITUTIONS IS A KIND OF POWER IN ITSELF WHEN HE WENT 
HOME ON LEAVE HE RIOTED ON A LARGE SCALEPOMPOUSLY JACK ASHOREWITH 
A DIFFERENCEIN EXTERNALS ONLY THIS ONE COULD GATHER FROM HIS CASUAL 
TALK HE ORIGINATED NOTHING HE COULD KEEP THE ROUTINE GOINGTHATS 
ALL BUT HE WAS GREAT HE WAS GREAT BY THIS LITTLE THING THAT IT WAS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT COULD CONTROL SUCH A MAN HE NEVER GAVE THAT 
SECRET AWAY PERHAPS THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN HIM SUCH A SUSPICION 
MADE ONE PAUSEFOR OUT THERE THERE WERE NO EXTERNAL CHECKS ONCE WHEN 
VARIOUS TROPICAL DISEASES HAD LAID LOW ALMOST EVERY AGENT IN THE 
STATION HE WAS HEARD TO SAY MEN WHO COME OUT HERE SHOULD HAVE NO 
ENTRAILS HE SEALED THE UTTERANCE WITH THAT SMILE OF HIS AS THOUGH 
IT HAD BEEN A DOOR OPENING INTO A DARKNESS HE HAD IN HIS KEEPING 
YOU FANCIED YOU HAD SEEN THINGSBUT THE SEAL WAS ON WHEN ANNOYED AT 
MEALTIMES BY THE CONSTANT QUARRELS OF THE WHITE MEN ABOUT PRECEDENCE 
HE ORDERED AN IMMENSE ROUND TABLE TO BE MADE FOR WHICH A SPECIAL HOUSE 
HAD TO BE BUILT THIS WAS THE STATIONS MESSROOM WHERE HE SAT WAS THE 
FIRST PLACETHE REST WERE NOWHERE ONE FELT THIS TO BE HIS UNALTERABLE 
CONVICTION HE WAS NEITHER CIVIL NOR UNCIVIL HE WAS QUIET HE ALLOWED 
HIS BOYAN OVERFED YOUNG NEGRO FROM THE COASTTO TREAT THE WHITE 
MEN UNDER HIS VERY EYES WITH PROVOKING INSOLENCE 
 
HE BEGAN TO SPEAK AS SOON AS HE SAW ME I HAD BEEN VERY LONG ON THE 
ROAD HE COULD NOT WAIT HAD TO START WITHOUT ME THE UPRIVER STATIONS 
HAD TO BE RELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN SO MANY DELAYS ALREADY THAT HE DID 
NOT KNOW WHO WAS DEAD AND WHO WAS ALIVE AND HOW THEY GOT ONAND SO ON 
AND SO ON HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO MY EXPLANATIONS AND PLAYING WITH 
A STICK OF SEALINGWAX REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT THE SITUATION 
WAS VERY GRAVE VERY GRAVE THERE WERE RUMORS THAT A VERY IMPORTANT 
STATION WAS IN JEOPARDY AND ITS CHIEF MR KURTZ WAS ILL HOPED IT WAS 
NOT TRUE MR KURTZ WAS    I FELT WEARY AND IRRITABLE HANG KURTZ 
I THOUGHT I INTERRUPTED HIM BY SAYING I HAD HEARD OF MR KURTZ ON THE 
COAST AH SO THEY TALK OF HIM DOWN THERE HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF 
THEN HE BEGAN AGAIN ASSURING ME MR KURTZ WAS THE BEST AGENT HE HAD AN 
EXCEPTIONAL MAN OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY THEREFORE 
I COULD UNDERSTAND HIS ANXIETY HE WAS HE SAID VERY VERY UNEASY 
CERTAINLY HE FIDGETED ON HIS CHAIR A GOOD DEAL EXCLAIMED AH MR 
KURTZ BROKE THE STICK OF SEALINGWAX AND SEEMED DUMBFOUNDED BY THE 
ACCIDENT NEXT THING HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO    
I INTERRUPTED HIM AGAIN BEING HUNGRY YOU KNOW AND KEPT ON MY FEET 
TOO I WAS GETTING SAVAGE HOW COULD I TELL I SAID I HADNT EVEN 
SEEN THE WRECK YETSOME MONTHS NO DOUBT ALL THIS TALK SEEMED TO ME 
SO FUTILE SOME MONTHS HE SAID WELL LET US SAY THREE MONTHS BEFORE 
WE CAN MAKE A START YES THAT OUGHT TO DO THE AFFAIR I FLUNG OUT 
OF HIS HUT HE LIVED ALL ALONE IN A CLAY HUT WITH A SORT OF VERANDA 
MUTTERING TO MYSELF MY OPINION OF HIM HE WAS A CHATTERING IDIOT 
AFTERWARDS I TOOK IT BACK WHEN IT WAS BORNE IN UPON ME STARTLINGLY 
WITH WHAT EXTREME NICETY HE HAD ESTIMATED THE TIME REQUISITE FOR THE 
AFFAIR 
 
I WENT TO WORK THE NEXT DAY TURNING SO TO SPEAK MY BACK ON THAT 
STATION IN THAT WAY ONLY IT SEEMED TO ME I COULD KEEP MY HOLD ON THE 
REDEEMING FACTS OF LIFE STILL ONE MUST LOOK ABOUT SOMETIMES AND THEN 
I SAW THIS STATION THESE MEN STROLLING AIMLESSLY ABOUT IN THE SUNSHINE 
OF THE YARD I ASKED MYSELF SOMETIMES WHAT IT ALL MEANT THEY WANDERED 
HERE AND THERE WITH THEIR ABSURD LONG STAVES IN THEIR HANDS LIKE A LOT 
OF FAITHLESS PILGRIMS BEWITCHED INSIDE A ROTTEN FENCE THE WORD IVORY 
RANG IN THE AIR WAS WHISPERED WAS SIGHED YOU WOULD THINK THEY WERE 
PRAYING TO IT A TAINT OF IMBECILE RAPACITY BLEW THROUGH IT ALL LIKE A 
WHIFF FROM SOME CORPSE BY JOVE IVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO UNREAL IN 
MY LIFE AND OUTSIDE THE SILENT WILDERNESS SURROUNDING THIS CLEARED 
SPECK ON THE EARTH STRUCK ME AS SOMETHING GREAT AND INVINCIBLE LIKE 
EVIL OR TRUTH WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THE PASSING AWAY OF THIS FANTASTIC 
INVASION 
 
OH THESE MONTHS WELL NEVER MIND VARIOUS THINGS HAPPENED ONE 
EVENING A GRASS SHED FULL OF CALICO COTTON PRINTS BEADS AND I DONT 
KNOW WHAT ELSE BURST INTO A BLAZE SO SUDDENLY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THE EARTH HAD OPENED TO LET AN AVENGING FIRE CONSUME ALL THAT 
TRASH I WAS SMOKING MY PIPE QUIETLY BY MY DISMANTLED STEAMER AND SAW 
THEM ALL CUTTING CAPERS IN THE LIGHT WITH THEIR ARMS LIFTED HIGH WHEN 
THE STOUT MAN WITH MUSTACHES CAME TEARING DOWN TO THE RIVER A TIN 
PAIL IN HIS HAND ASSURED ME THAT EVERYBODY WAS BEHAVING SPLENDIDLY 
SPLENDIDLY DIPPED ABOUT A QUART OF WATER AND TORE BACK AGAIN I 
NOTICED THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS PAIL 
 
I STROLLED UP THERE WAS NO HURRY YOU SEE THE THING HAD GONE OFF LIKE 
A BOX OF MATCHES IT HAD BEEN HOPELESS FROM THE VERY FIRST THE FLAME 
HAD LEAPED HIGH DRIVEN EVERYBODY BACK LIGHTED UP EVERYTHINGAND 
COLLAPSED THE SHED WAS ALREADY A HEAP OF EMBERS GLOWING FIERCELY A 
NIGGER WAS BEING BEATEN NEAR BY THEY SAID HE HAD CAUSED THE FIRE IN 
SOME WAY BE THAT AS IT MAY HE WAS SCREECHING MOST HORRIBLY I SAW HIM 
LATER ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS SITTING IN A BIT OF SHADE LOOKING VERY SICK 
AND TRYING TO RECOVER HIMSELF AFTERWARDS HE AROSE AND WENT OUTAND 
THE WILDERNESS WITHOUT A SOUND TOOK HIM INTO ITS BOSOM AGAIN AS I 
APPROACHED THE GLOW FROM THE DARK I FOUND MYSELF AT THE BACK OF TWO MEN 
TALKING I HEARD THE NAME OF KURTZ PRONOUNCED THEN THE WORDS TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT ONE OF THE MEN WAS THE MANAGER 
I WISHED HIM A GOOD EVENING DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE ITEH IT 
IS INCREDIBLE HE SAID AND WALKED OFF THE OTHER MAN REMAINED HE WAS 
A FIRSTCLASS AGENT YOUNG GENTLEMANLY A BIT RESERVED WITH A FORKED 
LITTLE BEARD AND A HOOKED NOSE HE WAS STANDOFFISH WITH THE OTHER 
AGENTS AND THEY ON THEIR SIDE SAID HE WAS THE MANAGERS SPY UPON THEM 
AS TO ME I HAD HARDLY EVER SPOKEN TO HIM BEFORE WE GOT INTO TALK AND 
BYANDBY WE STROLLED AWAY FROM THE HISSING RUINS THEN HE ASKED ME TO 
HIS ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE MAIN BUILDING OF THE STATION HE STRUCK 
A MATCH AND I PERCEIVED THAT THIS YOUNG ARISTOCRAT HAD NOT ONLY A 
SILVERMOUNTED DRESSINGCASE BUT ALSO A WHOLE CANDLE ALL TO HIMSELF 
JUST AT THAT TIME THE MANAGER WAS THE ONLY MAN SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY 
RIGHT TO CANDLES NATIVE MATS COVERED THE CLAY WALLS A COLLECTION OF 
SPEARS ASSEGAIS SHIELDS KNIVES WAS HUNG UP IN TROPHIES THE BUSINESS 
INTRUSTED TO THIS FELLOW WAS THE MAKING OF BRICKSSO I HAD BEEN 
INFORMED BUT THERE WASNT A FRAGMENT OF A BRICK ANYWHERE IN THE 
STATION AND HE HAD BEEN THERE MORE THAN A YEARWAITING IT SEEMS HE 
COULD NOT MAKE BRICKS WITHOUT SOMETHING I DONT KNOW WHATSTRAW MAYBE 
ANYWAYS IT COULD NOT BE FOUND THERE AND AS IT WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE 
SENT FROM EUROPE IT DID NOT APPEAR CLEAR TO ME WHAT HE WAS WAITING FOR 
AN ACT OF SPECIAL CREATION PERHAPS HOWEVER THEY WERE ALL WAITINGALL 
THE SIXTEEN OR TWENTY PILGRIMS OF THEMFOR SOMETHING AND UPON MY WORD 
IT DID NOT SEEM AN UNCONGENIAL OCCUPATION FROM THE WAY THEY TOOK IT 
THOUGH THE ONLY THING THAT EVER CAME TO THEM WAS DISEASEAS FAR AS I 
COULD SEE THEY BEGUILED THE TIME BY BACKBITING AND INTRIGUING AGAINST 
EACH OTHER IN A FOOLISH KIND OF WAY THERE WAS AN AIR OF PLOTTING ABOUT 
THAT STATION BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT OF COURSE IT WAS AS UNREAL AS 
EVERYTHING ELSEAS THE PHILANTHROPIC PRETENSE OF THE WHOLE CONCERN AS 
THEIR TALK AS THEIR GOVERNMENT AS THEIR SHOW OF WORK THE ONLY REAL 
FEELING WAS A DESIRE TO GET APPOINTED TO A TRADINGPOST WHERE IVORY 
WAS TO BE HAD SO THAT THEY COULD EARN PERCENTAGES THEY INTRIGUED 
AND SLANDERED AND HATED EACH OTHER ONLY ON THAT ACCOUNTBUT AS TO 
EFFECTUALLY LIFTING A LITTLE FINGEROH NO BY HEAVENS THERE IS 
SOMETHING AFTER ALL IN THE WORLD ALLOWING ONE MAN TO STEAL A HORSE WHILE 
ANOTHER MUST NOT LOOK AT A HALTER STEAL A HORSE STRAIGHT OUT VERY 
WELL HE HAS DONE IT PERHAPS HE CAN RIDE BUT THERE IS A WAY OF LOOKING 
AT A HALTER THAT WOULD PROVOKE THE MOST CHARITABLE OF SAINTS INTO A 
KICK 
 
I HAD NO IDEA WHY HE WANTED TO BE SOCIABLE BUT AS WE CHATTED IN THERE 
IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THE FELLOW WAS TRYING TO GET AT SOMETHINGIN 
FACT PUMPING ME HE ALLUDED CONSTANTLY TO EUROPE TO THE PEOPLE I WAS 
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THEREPUTTING LEADING QUESTIONS AS TO MY ACQUAINTANCES 
IN THE SEPULCHRAL CITY AND SO ON HIS LITTLE EYES GLITTERED LIKE 
MICA DISCSWITH CURIOSITYTHOUGH HE TRIED TO KEEP UP A BIT OF 
SUPERCILIOUSNESS AT FIRST I WAS ASTONISHED BUT VERY SOON I BECAME 
AWFULLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD FIND OUT FROM ME I COULDNT 
POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT I HAD IN ME TO MAKE IT WORTH HIS WHILE IT WAS 
VERY PRETTY TO SEE HOW HE BAFFLED HIMSELF FOR IN TRUTH MY BODY WAS FULL 
OF CHILLS AND MY HEAD HAD NOTHING IN IT BUT THAT WRETCHED STEAMBOAT 
BUSINESS IT WAS EVIDENT HE TOOK ME FOR A PERFECTLY SHAMELESS 
PREVARICATOR AT LAST HE GOT ANGRY AND TO CONCEAL A MOVEMENT OF FURIOUS 
ANNOYANCE HE YAWNED I ROSE THEN I NOTICED A SMALL SKETCH IN OILS 
ON A PANEL REPRESENTING A WOMAN DRAPED AND BLINDFOLDED CARRYING A 
LIGHTED TORCH THE BACKGROUND WAS SOMBERALMOST BLACK THE MOVEMENT OF 
THE WOMAN WAS STATELY AND THE EFFECT OF THE TORCHLIGHT ON THE FACE WAS 
SINISTER 
 
IT ARRESTED ME AND HE STOOD BY CIVILLY HOLDING A HALFPINT CHAMPAGNE 
BOTTLE MEDICAL COMFORTS WITH THE CANDLE STUCK IN IT TO MY QUESTION HE 
SAID MR KURTZ HAD PAINTED THISIN THIS VERY STATION MORE THAN A YEAR 
AGOWHILE WAITING FOR MEANS TO GO TO HIS TRADINGPOST TELL ME PRAY 
SAID I WHO IS THIS MR KURTZ 
 
THE CHIEF OF THE INNER STATION HE ANSWERED IN A SHORT TONE LOOKING 
AWAY MUCH OBLIGED I SAID LAUGHING AND YOU ARE THE BRICKMAKER OF 
THE CENTRAL STATION EVERYONE KNOWS THAT HE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE 
HE IS A PRODIGY HE SAID AT LAST HE IS AN EMISSARY OF PITY AND 
SCIENCE AND PROGRESS AND DEVIL KNOWS WHAT ELSE WE WANT HE BEGAN 
TO DECLAIM SUDDENLY FOR THE GUIDANCE OF THE CAUSE INTRUSTED TO US BY 
EUROPE SO TO SPEAK HIGHER INTELLIGENCE WIDE SYMPATHIES A SINGLENESS 
OF PURPOSE WHO SAYS THAT I ASKED LOTS OF THEM HE REPLIED SOME 
EVEN WRITE THAT AND SO HE COMES HERE A SPECIAL BEING AS YOU OUGHT 
TO KNOW WHY OUGHT I TO KNOW I INTERRUPTED REALLY SURPRISED HE 
PAID NO ATTENTION YES TODAY HE IS CHIEF OF THE BEST STATION NEXT 
YEAR HE WILL BE ASSISTANTMANAGER TWO YEARS MORE AND    BUT I DARE 
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT HE WILL BE IN TWO YEARS TIME YOU ARE OF THE NEW 
GANGTHE GANG OF VIRTUE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SENT HIM SPECIALLY ALSO 
RECOMMENDED YOU OH DONT SAY NO IVE MY OWN EYES TO TRUST LIGHT 
DAWNED UPON ME MY DEAR AUNTS INFLUENTIAL ACQUAINTANCES WERE PRODUCING 
AN UNEXPECTED EFFECT UPON THAT YOUNG MAN I NEARLY BURST INTO A LAUGH 
DO YOU READ THE COMPANYS CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE I ASKED HE 
HADNT A WORD TO SAY IT WAS GREAT FUN WHEN MR KURTZ I CONTINUED 
SEVERELY IS GENERAL MANAGER YOU WONT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
 
HE BLEW THE CANDLE OUT SUDDENLY AND WE WENT OUTSIDE THE MOON HAD 
RISEN BLACK FIGURES STROLLED ABOUT LISTLESSLY POURING WATER ON 
THE GLOW WHENCE PROCEEDED A SOUND OF HISSING STEAM ASCENDED IN THE 
MOONLIGHT THE BEATEN NIGGER GROANED SOMEWHERE WHAT A ROW THE BRUTE 
MAKES SAID THE INDEFATIGABLE MAN WITH THE MUSTACHES APPEARING 
NEAR US SERVE HIM RIGHT TRANSGRESSIONPUNISHMENTBANG PITILESS 
PITILESS THATS THE ONLY WAY THIS WILL PREVENT ALL CONFLAGRATIONS 
FOR THE FUTURE I WAS JUST TELLING THE MANAGER    HE NOTICED MY 
COMPANION AND BECAME CRESTFALLEN ALL AT ONCE NOT IN BED YET 
HE SAID WITH A KIND OF SERVILE HEARTINESS ITS SO NATURAL HA 
DANGERAGITATION HE VANISHED I WENT ON TO THE RIVERSIDE AND 
THE OTHER FOLLOWED ME I HEARD A SCATHING MURMUR AT MY EAR HEAP 
OF MUFFSGO TO THE PILGRIMS COULD BE SEEN IN KNOTS GESTICULATING 
DISCUSSING SEVERAL HAD STILL THEIR STAVES IN THEIR HANDS I VERILY 
BELIEVE THEY TOOK THESE STICKS TO BED WITH THEM BEYOND THE FENCE THE 
FOREST STOOD UP SPECTRALLY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND THROUGH THE DIM STIR 
THROUGH THE FAINT SOUNDS OF THAT LAMENTABLE COURTYARD THE SILENCE OF 
THE LAND WENT HOME TO ONES VERY HEARTITS MYSTERY ITS GREATNESS 
THE AMAZING REALITY OF ITS CONCEALED LIFE THE HURT NIGGER MOANED FEEBLY 
SOMEWHERE NEAR BY AND THEN FETCHED A DEEP SIGH THAT MADE ME MEND MY 
PACE AWAY FROM THERE I FELT A HAND INTRODUCING ITSELF UNDER MY ARM 
MY DEAR SIR SAID THE FELLOW I DONT WANT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND 
ESPECIALLY BY YOU WHO WILL SEE MR KURTZ LONG BEFORE I CAN HAVE THAT 
PLEASURE I WOULDNT LIKE HIM TO GET A FALSE IDEA OF MY 
DISPOSITION    
 
 
I LET HIM RUN ON THIS PAPIERMACHE MEPHISTOPHELES AND IT SEEMED TO 
ME THAT IF I TRIED I COULD POKE MY FOREFINGER THROUGH HIM AND WOULD FIND 
NOTHING INSIDE BUT A LITTLE LOOSE DIRT MAYBE HE DONT YOU SEE HAD 
BEEN PLANNING TO BE ASSISTANTMANAGER BYANDBY UNDER THE PRESENT MAN 
AND I COULD SEE THAT THE COMING OF THAT KURTZ HAD UPSET THEM BOTH NOT A 
LITTLE HE TALKED PRECIPITATELY AND I DID NOT TRY TO STOP HIM I HAD MY 
SHOULDERS AGAINST THE WRECK OF MY STEAMER HAULED UP ON THE SLOPE LIKE A 
CARCASS OF SOME BIG RIVER ANIMAL THE SMELL OF MUD OF PRIMEVAL MUD 
BY JOVE WAS IN MY NOSTRILS THE HIGH STILLNESS OF PRIMEVAL FOREST WAS 
BEFORE MY EYES THERE WERE SHINY PATCHES ON THE BLACK CREEK THE MOON 
HAD SPREAD OVER EVERYTHING A THIN LAYER OF SILVEROVER THE RANK GRASS 
OVER THE MUD UPON THE WALL OF MATTED VEGETATION STANDING HIGHER THAN 
THE WALL OF A TEMPLE OVER THE GREAT RIVER I COULD SEE THROUGH A SOMBER 
GAP GLITTERING GLITTERING AS IT FLOWED BROADLY BY WITHOUT A MURMUR 
ALL THIS WAS GREAT EXPECTANT MUTE WHILE THE MAN JABBERED ABOUT 
HIMSELF I WONDERED WHETHER THE STILLNESS ON THE FACE OF THE IMMENSITY 
LOOKING AT US TWO WERE MEANT AS AN APPEAL OR AS A MENACE WHAT WERE WE 
WHO HAD STRAYED IN HERE COULD WE HANDLE THAT DUMB THING OR WOULD IT 
HANDLE US I FELT HOW BIG HOW CONFOUNDEDLY BIG WAS THAT THING THAT 
COULDNT TALK AND PERHAPS WAS DEAF AS WELL WHAT WAS IN THERE I COULD 
SEE A LITTLE IVORY COMING OUT FROM THERE AND I HAD HEARD MR KURTZ WAS 
IN THERE I HAD HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT IT TOOGOD KNOWS YET SOMEHOW IT 
DIDNT BRING ANY IMAGE WITH ITNO MORE THAN IF I HAD BEEN TOLD AN ANGEL 
OR A FIEND WAS IN THERE I BELIEVED IT IN THE SAME WAY ONE OF YOU MIGHT 
BELIEVE THERE ARE INHABITANTS IN THE PLANET MARS I KNEW ONCE A SCOTCH 
SAILMAKER WHO WAS CERTAIN DEAD SURE THERE WERE PEOPLE IN MARS IF YOU 
ASKED HIM FOR SOME IDEA HOW THEY LOOKED AND BEHAVED HE WOULD GET SHY 
AND MUTTER SOMETHING ABOUT WALKING ON ALLFOURS IF YOU AS MUCH AS 
SMILED HE WOULDTHOUGH A MAN OF SIXTYOFFER TO FIGHT YOU I WOULD NOT 
HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO FIGHT FOR KURTZ BUT I WENT FOR HIM NEAR ENOUGH 
TO A LIE YOU KNOW I HATE DETEST AND CANT BEAR A LIE NOT BECAUSE 
I AM STRAIGHTER THAN THE REST OF US BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT APPALLS ME 
THERE IS A TAINT OF DEATH A FLAVOR OF MORTALITY IN LIESWHICH IS 
EXACTLY WHAT I HATE AND DETEST IN THE WORLDWHAT I WANT TO FORGET 
IT MAKES ME MISERABLE AND SICK LIKE BITING SOMETHING ROTTEN WOULD DO 
TEMPERAMENT I SUPPOSE WELL I WENT NEAR ENOUGH TO IT BY LETTING THE 
YOUNG FOOL THERE BELIEVE ANYTHING HE LIKED TO IMAGINE AS TO MY INFLUENCE 
IN EUROPE I BECAME IN AN INSTANT AS MUCH OF A PRETENSE AS THE REST OF 
THE BEWITCHED PILGRIMS THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAD A NOTION IT SOMEHOW 
WOULD BE OF HELP TO THAT KURTZ WHOM AT THE TIME I DID NOT SEEYOU 
UNDERSTAND HE WAS JUST A WORD FOR ME I DID NOT SEE THE MAN IN THE NAME 
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO DO YOU SEE HIM DO YOU SEE THE STORY DO YOU SEE 
ANYTHING IT SEEMS TO ME I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU A DREAMMAKING A VAIN 
ATTEMPT BECAUSE NO RELATION OF A DREAM CAN CONVEY THE DREAMSENSATION 
THAT COMMINGLING OF ABSURDITY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERMENT IN A TREMOR OF 
STRUGGLING REVOLT THAT NOTION OF BEING CAPTURED BY THE INCREDIBLE WHICH 
IS OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF DREAMS    
 
HE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE 
 
   NO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY THE 
LIFESENSATION OF ANY GIVEN EPOCH OF ONES EXISTENCETHAT WHICH 
MAKES ITS TRUTH ITS MEANINGITS SUBTLE AND PENETRATING ESSENCE IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE WE LIVE AS WE DREAMALONE    
 
HE PAUSED AGAIN AS IF REFLECTING THEN ADDEDOF COURSE IN THIS YOU 
FELLOWS SEE MORE THAN I COULD THEN YOU SEE ME WHOM YOU KNOW    
 
IT HAD BECOME SO PITCH DARK THAT WE LISTENERS COULD HARDLY SEE ONE 
ANOTHER FOR A LONG TIME ALREADY HE SITTING APART HAD BEEN NO MORE 
TO US THAN A VOICE THERE WAS NOT A WORD FROM ANYBODY THE OTHERS MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN ASLEEP BUT I WAS AWAKE I LISTENED I LISTENED ON THE WATCH 
FOR THE SENTENCE FOR THE WORD THAT WOULD GIVE ME THE CLEW TO THE 
FAINT UNEASINESS INSPIRED BY THIS NARRATIVE THAT SEEMED TO SHAPE ITSELF 
WITHOUT HUMAN LIPS IN THE HEAVY NIGHTAIR OF THE RIVER 
 
   YESI LET HIM RUN ON MARLOW BEGAN AGAIN AND THINK WHAT 
HE PLEASED ABOUT THE POWERS THAT WERE BEHIND ME I DID AND THERE WAS 
NOTHING BEHIND ME THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THAT WRETCHED OLD MANGLED 
STEAMBOAT I WAS LEANING AGAINST WHILE HE TALKED FLUENTLY ABOUT THE 
NECESSITY FOR EVERY MAN TO GET ON AND WHEN ONE COMES OUT HERE YOU 
CONCEIVE IT IS NOT TO GAZE AT THE MOON MR KURTZ WAS A UNIVERSAL 
GENIUS BUT EVEN A GENIUS WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO WORK WITH ADEQUATE 
TOOLSINTELLIGENT MEN HE DID NOT MAKE BRICKSWHY THERE WAS A 
PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE WAYAS I WAS WELL AWARE AND IF HE 
DID SECRETARIAL WORK FOR THE MANAGER IT WAS BECAUSE NO SENSIBLE MAN 
REJECTS WANTONLY THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS SUPERIORS DID I SEE IT I SAW 
IT WHAT MORE DID I WANT WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS RIVETS BY HEAVEN 
RIVETS TO GET ON WITH THE WORKTO STOP THE HOLE RIVETS I 
WANTED THERE WERE CASES OF THEM DOWN AT THE COASTCASESPILED 
UPBURSTSPLIT YOU KICKED A LOOSE RIVET AT EVERY SECOND STEP IN THAT 
STATION YARD ON THE HILLSIDE RIVETS HAD ROLLED INTO THE GROVE OF DEATH 
YOU COULD FILL YOUR POCKETS WITH RIVETS FOR THE TROUBLE OF STOOPING 
DOWNAND THERE WASNT ONE RIVET TO BE FOUND WHERE IT WAS WANTED WE HAD 
PLATES THAT WOULD DO BUT NOTHING TO FASTEN THEM WITH AND EVERY WEEK 
THE MESSENGER A LONE NEGRO LETTERBAG ON SHOULDER AND STAFF IN HAND 
LEFT OUR STATION FOR THE COAST AND SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK A COAST CARAVAN 
CAME IN WITH TRADE GOODSGHASTLY GLAZED CALICO THAT MADE YOU SHUDDER 
ONLY TO LOOK AT IT GLASS BEADS VALUE ABOUT A PENNY A QUART CONFOUNDED 
SPOTTED COTTON HANDKERCHIEFS AND NO RIVETS THREE CARRIERS COULD HAVE 
BROUGHT ALL THAT WAS WANTED TO SET THAT STEAMBOAT AFLOAT 
 
HE WAS BECOMING CONFIDENTIAL NOW BUT I FANCY MY UNRESPONSIVE ATTITUDE 
MUST HAVE EXASPERATED HIM AT LAST FOR HE JUDGED IT NECESSARY TO INFORM 
ME HE FEARED NEITHER GOD NOR DEVIL LET ALONE ANY MERE MAN I SAID I 
COULD SEE THAT VERY WELL BUT WHAT I WANTED WAS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF 
RIVETSAND RIVETS WERE WHAT REALLY MR KURTZ WANTED IF HE HAD ONLY 
KNOWN IT NOW LETTERS WENT TO THE COAST EVERY WEEK    MY DEAR 
SIR HE CRIED I WRITE FROM DICTATION I DEMANDED RIVETS THERE WAS 
A WAYFOR AN INTELLIGENT MAN HE CHANGED HIS MANNER BECAME VERY 
COLD AND SUDDENLY BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT A HIPPOPOTAMUS WONDERED WHETHER 
SLEEPING ON BOARD THE STEAMER I STUCK TO MY SALVAGE NIGHT AND DAY 
I WASNT DISTURBED THERE WAS AN OLD HIPPO THAT HAD THE BAD HABIT OF 
GETTING OUT ON THE BANK AND ROAMING AT NIGHT OVER THE STATION GROUNDS 
THE PILGRIMS USED TO TURN OUT IN A BODY AND EMPTY EVERY RIFLE THEY COULD 
LAY HANDS ON AT HIM SOME EVEN HAD SAT UP O NIGHTS FOR HIM ALL THIS 
ENERGY WAS WASTED THOUGH THAT ANIMAL HAS A CHARMED LIFE HE SAID 
BUT YOU CAN SAY THIS ONLY OF BRUTES IN THIS COUNTRY NO MANYOU 
APPREHEND MENO MAN HERE BEARS A CHARMED LIFE HE STOOD THERE FOR 
A MOMENT IN THE MOONLIGHT WITH HIS DELICATE HOOKED NOSE SET A LITTLE 
ASKEW AND HIS MICA EYES GLITTERING WITHOUT A WINK THEN WITH A CURT 
GOOD NIGHT HE STRODE OFF I COULD SEE HE WAS DISTURBED AND CONSIDERABLY 
PUZZLED WHICH MADE ME FEEL MORE HOPEFUL THAN I HAD BEEN FOR DAYS IT 
WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO TURN FROM THAT CHAP TO MY INFLUENTIAL FRIEND THE 
BATTERED TWISTED RUINED TINPOT STEAMBOAT I CLAMBERED ON BOARD SHE 
RANG UNDER MY FEET LIKE AN EMPTY HUNTLEY  PALMER BISCUITTIN KICKED 
ALONG A GUTTER SHE WAS NOTHING SO SOLID IN MAKE AND RATHER LESS PRETTY 
IN SHAPE BUT I HAD EXPENDED ENOUGH HARD WORK ON HER TO MAKE ME LOVE 
HER NO INFLUENTIAL FRIEND WOULD HAVE SERVED ME BETTER SHE HAD GIVEN 
ME A CHANCE TO COME OUT A BITTO FIND OUT WHAT I COULD DO NO I DONT 
LIKE WORK I HAD RATHER LAZE ABOUT AND THINK OF ALL THE FINE THINGS THAT 
CAN BE DONE I DONT LIKE WORKNO MAN DOESBUT I LIKE WHAT IS IN THE 
WORKTHE CHANCE TO FIND YOURSELF YOUR OWN REALITYFOR YOURSELF NOT 
FOR OTHERSWHAT NO OTHER MAN CAN EVER KNOW THEY CAN ONLY SEE THE MERE 
SHOW AND NEVER CAN TELL WHAT IT REALLY MEANS 
 
I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE SOMEBODY SITTING AFT ON THE DECK WITH 
HIS LEGS DANGLING OVER THE MUD YOU SEE I RATHER CHUMMED WITH THE FEW 
MECHANICS THERE WERE IN THAT STATION WHOM THE OTHER PILGRIMS NATURALLY 
DESPISEDON ACCOUNT OF THEIR IMPERFECT MANNERS I SUPPOSE THIS WAS THE 
FOREMANA BOILERMAKER BY TRADEA GOOD WORKER HE WAS A LANK BONY 
YELLOWFACED MAN WITH BIG INTENSE EYES HIS ASPECT WAS WORRIED AND HIS 
HEAD WAS AS BALD AS THE PALM OF MY HAND BUT HIS HAIR IN FALLING SEEMED 
TO HAVE STUCK TO HIS CHIN AND HAD PROSPERED IN THE NEW LOCALITY 
FOR HIS BEARD HUNG DOWN TO HIS WAIST HE WAS A WIDOWER WITH SIX YOUNG 
CHILDREN HE HAD LEFT THEM IN CHARGE OF A SISTER OF HIS TO COME OUT 
THERE AND THE PASSION OF HIS LIFE WAS PIGEONFLYING HE WAS AN 
ENTHUSIAST AND A CONNOISSEUR HE WOULD RAVE ABOUT PIGEONS AFTER WORK 
HOURS HE USED SOMETIMES TO COME OVER FROM HIS HUT FOR A TALK ABOUT HIS 
CHILDREN AND HIS PIGEONS AT WORK WHEN HE HAD TO CRAWL IN THE MUD UNDER 
THE BOTTOM OF THE STEAMBOAT HE WOULD TIE UP THAT BEARD OF HIS IN A KIND 
OF WHITE SERVIETTE HE BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE IT HAD LOOPS TO GO OVER 
HIS EARS IN THE EVENING HE COULD BE SEEN SQUATTED ON THE BANK RINSING 
THAT WRAPPER IN THE CREEK WITH GREAT CARE THEN SPREADING IT SOLEMNLY ON 
A BUSH TO DRY 
 
I SLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND SHOUTED WE SHALL HAVE RIVETS HE 
SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET EXCLAIMING NO RIVETS AS THOUGH HE COULDNT 
BELIEVE HIS EARS THEN IN A LOW VOICE YOU    EH I DONT KNOW WHY 
WE BEHAVED LIKE LUNATICS I PUT MY FINGER TO THE SIDE OF MY NOSE AND 
NODDED MYSTERIOUSLY GOOD FOR YOU HE CRIED SNAPPED HIS FINGERS ABOVE 
HIS HEAD LIFTING ONE FOOT I TRIED A JIG WE CAPERED ON THE IRON DECK 
A FRIGHTFUL CLATTER CAME OUT OF THAT HULK AND THE VIRGIN FOREST ON 
THE OTHER BANK OF THE CREEK SENT IT BACK IN A THUNDERING ROLL UPON THE 
SLEEPING STATION IT MUST HAVE MADE SOME OF THE PILGRIMS SIT UP IN THEIR 
HOVELS A DARK FIGURE OBSCURED THE LIGHTED DOORWAY OF THE MANAGERS HUT 
VANISHED THEN A SECOND OR SO AFTER THE DOORWAY ITSELF VANISHED TOO 
WE STOPPED AND THE SILENCE DRIVEN AWAY BY THE STAMPING OF OUR FEET 
FLOWED BACK AGAIN FROM THE RECESSES OF THE LAND THE GREAT WALL OF 
VEGETATION AN EXUBERANT AND ENTANGLED MASS OF TRUNKS BRANCHES LEAVES 
BOUGHS FESTOONS MOTIONLESS IN THE MOONLIGHT WAS LIKE A RIOTING 
INVASION OF SOUNDLESS LIFE A ROLLING WAVE OF PLANTS PILED UP CRESTED 
READY TO TOPPLE OVER THE CREEK TO SWEEP EVERY LITTLE MAN OF US OUT 
OF HIS LITTLE EXISTENCE AND IT MOVED NOT A DEADENED BURST OF MIGHTY 
SPLASHES AND SNORTS REACHED US FROM AFAR AS THOUGH AN ICHTHYOSAURUS HAD 
BEEN TAKING A BATH OF GLITTER IN THE GREAT RIVER AFTER ALL SAID THE 
BOILERMAKER IN A REASONABLE TONE WHY SHOULDNT WE GET THE RIVETS 
WHY NOT INDEED I DID NOT KNOW OF ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULDNT THEYLL 
COME IN THREE WEEKS I SAID CONFIDENTLY 
 
BUT THEY DIDNT INSTEAD OF RIVETS THERE CAME AN INVASION AN 
INFLICTION A VISITATION IT CAME IN SECTIONS DURING THE NEXT THREE 
WEEKS EACH SECTION HEADED BY A DONKEY CARRYING A WHITE MAN IN NEW 
CLOTHES AND TAN SHOES BOWING FROM THAT ELEVATION RIGHT AND LEFT TO THE 
IMPRESSED PILGRIMS A QUARRELSOME BAND OF FOOTSORE SULKY NIGGERS TROD ON 
THE HEELS OF THE DONKEYS A LOT OF TENTS CAMPSTOOLS TIN BOXES WHITE 
CASES BROWN BALES WOULD BE SHOT DOWN IN THE COURTYARD AND THE AIR OF 
MYSTERY WOULD DEEPEN A LITTLE OVER THE MUDDLE OF THE STATION FIVE SUCH 
INSTALLMENTS CAME WITH THEIR ABSURD AIR OF DISORDERLY FLIGHT WITH THE 
LOOT OF INNUMERABLE OUTFIT SHOPS AND PROVISION STORES THAT ONE 
WOULD THINK THEY WERE LUGGING AFTER A RAID INTO THE WILDERNESS FOR 
EQUITABLE DIVISION IT WAS AN INEXTRICABLE MESS OF THINGS DECENT IN 
THEMSELVES BUT THAT HUMAN FOLLY MADE LOOK LIKE THE SPOILS OF THIEVING 
 
THIS DEVOTED BAND CALLED ITSELF THE ELDORADO EXPLORING EXPEDITION AND 
I BELIEVE THEY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY THEIR TALK HOWEVER WAS THE TALK 
OF SORDID BUCCANEERS IT WAS RECKLESS WITHOUT HARDIHOOD GREEDY WITHOUT 
AUDACITY AND CRUEL WITHOUT COURAGE THERE WAS NOT AN ATOM OF FORESIGHT 
OR OF SERIOUS INTENTION IN THE WHOLE BATCH OF THEM AND THEY DID NOT 
SEEM AWARE THESE THINGS ARE WANTED FOR THE WORK OF THE WORLD TO TEAR 
TREASURE OUT OF THE BOWELS OF THE LAND WAS THEIR DESIRE WITH NO MORE 
MORAL PURPOSE AT THE BACK OF IT THAN THERE IS IN BURGLARS BREAKING INTO 
A SAFE WHO PAID THE EXPENSES OF THE NOBLE ENTERPRISE I DONT KNOW BUT 
THE UNCLE OF OUR MANAGER WAS LEADER OF THAT LOT 
 
IN EXTERIOR HE RESEMBLED A BUTCHER IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD AND HIS EYES 
HAD A LOOK OF SLEEPY CUNNING HE CARRIED HIS FAT PAUNCH WITH OSTENTATION 
ON HIS SHORT LEGS AND DURING THE TIME HIS GANG INFESTED THE STATION 
SPOKE TO NO ONE BUT HIS NEPHEW YOU COULD SEE THESE TWO ROAMING ABOUT 
ALL DAY LONG WITH THEIR HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER IN AN EVERLASTING CONFAB 
 
I HAD GIVEN UP WORRYING MYSELF ABOUT THE RIVETS ONES CAPACITY FOR 
THAT KIND OF FOLLY IS MORE LIMITED THAN YOU WOULD SUPPOSE I SAID 
HANGAND LET THINGS SLIDE I HAD PLENTY OF TIME FOR MEDITATION 
AND NOW AND THEN I WOULD GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO KURTZ I WASNT VERY 
INTERESTED IN HIM NO STILL I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHETHER THIS MAN WHO 
HAD COME OUT EQUIPPED WITH MORAL IDEAS OF SOME SORT WOULD CLIMB TO THE 
TOP AFTER ALL AND HOW HE WOULD SET ABOUT HIS WORK WHEN THERE 
 
 
II 
 
 
ONE EVENING AS I WAS LYING FLAT ON THE DECK OF MY STEAMBOAT I HEARD 
VOICES APPROACHINGAND THERE WERE THE NEPHEW AND THE UNCLE STROLLING 
ALONG THE BANK I LAID MY HEAD ON MY ARM AGAIN AND HAD NEARLY LOST 
MYSELF IN A DOZE WHEN SOMEBODY SAID IN MY EAR AS IT WERE I AM AS 
HARMLESS AS A LITTLE CHILD BUT I DONT LIKE TO BE DICTATED TO AM I THE 
MANAGEROR AM I NOT I WAS ORDERED TO SEND HIM THERE ITS INCREDIBLE 
   I BECAME AWARE THAT THE TWO WERE STANDING ON THE SHORE ALONGSIDE 
THE FOREPART OF THE STEAMBOAT JUST BELOW MY HEAD I DID NOT MOVE IT 
DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO MOVE I WAS SLEEPY IT IS UNPLEASANT GRUNTED 
THE UNCLE HE HAS ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE SENT THERE SAID THE 
OTHER WITH THE IDEA OF SHOWING WHAT HE COULD DO AND I WAS INSTRUCTED 
ACCORDINGLY LOOK AT THE INFLUENCE THAT MAN MUST HAVE IS IT NOT 
FRIGHTFUL THEY BOTH AGREED IT WAS FRIGHTFUL THEN MADE SEVERAL BIZARRE 
REMARKS MAKE RAIN AND FINE WEATHERONE MANTHE COUNCILBY THE 
NOSEBITS OF ABSURD SENTENCES THAT GOT THE BETTER OF MY DROWSINESS 
SO THAT I HAD PRETTY NEAR THE WHOLE OF MY WITS ABOUT ME WHEN THE UNCLE 
SAID THE CLIMATE MAY DO AWAY WITH THIS DIFFICULTY FOR YOU IS HE ALONE 
THERE YES ANSWERED THE MANAGER HE SENT HIS ASSISTANT DOWN THE 
RIVER WITH A NOTE TO ME IN THESE TERMS CLEAR THIS POOR DEVIL OUT OF 
THE COUNTRY AND DONT BOTHER SENDING MORE OF THAT SORT I HAD RATHER BE 
ALONE THAN HAVE THE KIND OF MEN YOU CAN DISPOSE OF WITH ME IT WAS MORE 
THAN A YEAR AGO CAN YOU IMAGINE SUCH IMPUDENCE ANYTHING SINCE 
THEN ASKED THE OTHER HOARSELY IVORY JERKED THE NEPHEW LOTS 
OF ITPRIME SORTLOTSMOST ANNOYING FROM HIM AND WITH THAT 
QUESTIONED THE HEAVY RUMBLE INVOICE WAS THE REPLY FIRED OUT SO TO 
SPEAK THEN SILENCE THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT KURTZ 
 
I WAS BROAD AWAKE BY THIS TIME BUT LYING PERFECTLY AT EASE REMAINED 
STILL HAVING NO INDUCEMENT TO CHANGE MY POSITION HOW DID THAT IVORY 
COME ALL THIS WAY GROWLED THE ELDER MAN WHO SEEMED VERY VEXED THE 
OTHER EXPLAINED THAT IT HAD COME WITH A FLEET OF CANOES IN CHARGE OF AN 
ENGLISH HALFCASTE CLERK KURTZ HAD WITH HIM THAT KURTZ HAD APPARENTLY 
INTENDED TO RETURN HIMSELF THE STATION BEING BY THAT TIME BARE OF GOODS 
AND STORES BUT AFTER COMING THREE HUNDRED MILES HAD SUDDENLY DECIDED 
TO GO BACK WHICH HE STARTED TO DO ALONE IN A SMALL DUGOUT WITH FOUR 
PADDLERS LEAVING THE HALFCASTE TO CONTINUE DOWN THE RIVER WITH THE 
IVORY THE TWO FELLOWS THERE SEEMED ASTOUNDED AT ANYBODY ATTEMPTING SUCH 
A THING THEY WERE AT A LOSS FOR AN ADEQUATE MOTIVE AS TO ME I SEEMED 
TO SEE KURTZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE THE DUGOUT 
FOUR PADDLING SAVAGES AND THE LONE WHITE MAN TURNING HIS BACK SUDDENLY 
ON THE HEADQUARTERS ON RELIEF ON THOUGHTS OF HOMEPERHAPS SETTING 
HIS FACE TOWARDS THE DEPTHS OF THE WILDERNESS TOWARDS HIS EMPTY AND 
DESOLATE STATION I DID NOT KNOW THE MOTIVE PERHAPS HE WAS JUST SIMPLY 
A FINE FELLOW WHO STUCK TO HIS WORK FOR ITS OWN SAKE HIS NAME YOU 
UNDERSTAND HAD NOT BEEN PRONOUNCED ONCE HE WAS THAT MAN THE 
HALFCASTE WHO AS FAR AS I COULD SEE HAD CONDUCTED A DIFFICULT 
TRIP WITH GREAT PRUDENCE AND PLUCK WAS INVARIABLY ALLUDED TO AS THAT 
SCOUNDREL THE SCOUNDREL HAD REPORTED THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN VERY 
ILLHAD RECOVERED IMPERFECTLY    THE TWO BELOW ME MOVED AWAY THEN A 
FEW PACES AND STROLLED BACK AND FORTH AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE I HEARD 
MILITARY POSTDOCTORTWO HUNDRED MILESQUITE ALONE NOWUNAVOIDABLE 
DELAYSNINE MONTHSNO NEWSSTRANGE RUMORS THEY APPROACHED AGAIN 
JUST AS THE MANAGER WAS SAYING NO ONE AS FAR AS I KNOW UNLESS A 
SPECIES OF WANDERING TRADERA PESTILENTIAL FELLOW SNAPPING IVORY FROM 
THE NATIVES WHO WAS IT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW I GATHERED IN 
SNATCHES THAT THIS WAS SOME MAN SUPPOSED TO BE IN KURTZS DISTRICT AND 
OF WHOM THE MANAGER DID NOT APPROVE WE WILL NOT BE FREE FROM UNFAIR 
COMPETITION TILL ONE OF THESE FELLOWS IS HANGED FOR AN EXAMPLE 
HE SAID CERTAINLY GRUNTED THE OTHER GET HIM HANGED WHY NOT 
ANYTHINGANYTHING CAN BE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY THATS WHAT I SAY 
NOBODY HERE YOU UNDERSTAND HERE CAN ENDANGER YOUR POSITION AND 
WHY YOU STAND THE CLIMATEYOU OUTLAST THEM ALL THE DANGER IS IN 
EUROPE BUT THERE BEFORE I LEFT I TOOK CARE TO THEY MOVED OFF AND 
WHISPERED THEN THEIR VOICES ROSE AGAIN THE EXTRAORDINARY SERIES OF 
DELAYS IS NOT MY FAULT I DID MY POSSIBLE THE FAT MAN SIGHED VERY 
SAD AND THE PESTIFEROUS ABSURDITY OF HIS TALK CONTINUED THE OTHER 
HE BOTHERED ME ENOUGH WHEN HE WAS HERE EACH STATION SHOULD BE LIKE A 
BEACON ON THE ROAD TOWARDS BETTER THINGS A CENTER FOR TRADE OF COURSE 
BUT ALSO FOR HUMANIZING IMPROVING INSTRUCTING CONCEIVE YOUTHAT 
ASS AND HE WANTS TO BE MANAGER NO ITS HERE HE GOT CHOKED BY 
EXCESSIVE INDIGNATION AND I LIFTED MY HEAD THE LEAST BIT I WAS 
SURPRISED TO SEE HOW NEAR THEY WERERIGHT UNDER ME I COULD HAVE SPAT 
UPON THEIR HATS THEY WERE LOOKING ON THE GROUND ABSORBED IN THOUGHT 
THE MANAGER WAS SWITCHING HIS LEG WITH A SLENDER TWIG HIS SAGACIOUS 
RELATIVE LIFTED HIS HEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WELL SINCE YOU CAME OUT THIS 
TIME HE ASKED THE OTHER GAVE A START WHO I OH LIKE A CHARMLIKE 
A CHARM BUT THE RESTOH MY GOODNESS ALL SICK THEY DIE SO QUICK 
TOO THAT I HAVENT THE TIME TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRYITS 
INCREDIBLE HM JUST SO GRUNTED THE UNCLE AH MY BOY TRUST TO 
THISI SAY TRUST TO THIS I SAW HIM EXTEND HIS SHORT FLIPPER OF 
AN ARM FOR A GESTURE THAT TOOK IN THE FOREST THE CREEK THE MUD THE 
RIVERSEEMED TO BECKON WITH A DISHONORING FLOURISH BEFORE THE SUNLIT 
FACE OF THE LAND A TREACHEROUS APPEAL TO THE LURKING DEATH TO THE 
HIDDEN EVIL TO THE PROFOUND DARKNESS OF ITS HEART IT WAS SO STARTLING 
THAT I LEAPED TO MY FEET AND LOOKED BACK AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AS 
THOUGH I HAD EXPECTED AN ANSWER OF SOME SORT TO THAT BLACK DISPLAY OF 
CONFIDENCE YOU KNOW THE FOOLISH NOTIONS THAT COME TO ONE SOMETIMES THE 
HIGH STILLNESS CONFRONTED THESE TWO FIGURES WITH ITS OMINOUS PATIENCE 
WAITING FOR THE PASSING AWAY OF A FANTASTIC INVASION 
 
THEY SWORE ALOUD TOGETHEROUT OF SHEER FRIGHT I BELIEVETHEN 
PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING OF MY EXISTENCE TURNED BACK TO THE 
STATION THE SUN WAS LOW AND LEANING FORWARD SIDE BY SIDE THEY SEEMED 
TO BE TUGGING PAINFULLY UPHILL THEIR TWO RIDICULOUS SHADOWS OF UNEQUAL 
LENGTH THAT TRAILED BEHIND THEM SLOWLY OVER THE TALL GRASS WITHOUT 
BENDING A SINGLE BLADE 
 
IN A FEW DAYS THE ELDORADO EXPEDITION WENT INTO THE PATIENT WILDERNESS 
THAT CLOSED UPON IT AS THE SEA CLOSES OVER A DIVER LONG AFTERWARDS THE 
NEWS CAME THAT ALL THE DONKEYS WERE DEAD I KNOW NOTHING AS TO THE FATE 
OF THE LESS VALUABLE ANIMALS THEY NO DOUBT LIKE THE REST OF US FOUND 
WHAT THEY DESERVED I DID NOT INQUIRE I WAS THEN RATHER EXCITED AT 
THE PROSPECT OF MEETING KURTZ VERY SOON WHEN I SAY VERY SOON I MEAN 
IT COMPARATIVELY IT WAS JUST TWO MONTHS FROM THE DAY WE LEFT THE CREEK 
WHEN WE CAME TO THE BANK BELOW KURTZS STATION 
 
GOING UP THAT RIVER WAS LIKE TRAVELING BACK TO THE EARLIEST BEGINNINGS 
OF THE WORLD WHEN VEGETATION RIOTED ON THE EARTH AND THE BIG TREES WERE 
KINGS AN EMPTY STREAM A GREAT SILENCE AN IMPENETRABLE FOREST THE AIR 
WAS WARM THICK HEAVY SLUGGISH THERE WAS NO JOY IN THE BRILLIANCE OF 
SUNSHINE THE LONG STRETCHES OF THE WATERWAY RAN ON DESERTED INTO 
THE GLOOM OF OVERSHADOWED DISTANCES ON SILVERY SANDBANKS HIPPOS AND 
ALLIGATORS SUNNED THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE THE BROADENING WATERS FLOWED 
THROUGH A MOB OF WOODED ISLANDS YOU LOST YOUR WAY ON THAT RIVER AS YOU 
WOULD IN A DESERT AND BUTTED ALL DAY LONG AGAINST SHOALS TRYING TO 
FIND THE CHANNEL TILL YOU THOUGHT YOURSELF BEWITCHED AND CUT OFF FOR 
EVER FROM EVERYTHING YOU HAD KNOWN ONCESOMEWHEREFAR AWAYIN ANOTHER 
EXISTENCE PERHAPS THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN ONES PAST CAME BACK TO ONE 
AS IT WILL SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE NOT A MOMENT TO SPARE TO YOURSELF 
BUT IT CAME IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNRESTFUL AND NOISY DREAM REMEMBERED 
WITH WONDER AMONGST THE OVERWHELMING REALITIES OF THIS STRANGE WORLD OF 
PLANTS AND WATER AND SILENCE AND THIS STILLNESS OF LIFE DID NOT IN 
THE LEAST RESEMBLE A PEACE IT WAS THE STILLNESS OF AN IMPLACABLE FORCE 
BROODING OVER AN INSCRUTABLE INTENTION IT LOOKED AT YOU WITH A VENGEFUL 
ASPECT I GOT USED TO IT AFTERWARDS I DID NOT SEE IT ANY MORE I HAD NO 
TIME I HAD TO KEEP GUESSING AT THE CHANNEL I HAD TO DISCERN MOSTLY BY 
INSPIRATION THE SIGNS OF HIDDEN BANKS I WATCHED FOR SUNKEN STONES I 
WAS LEARNING TO CLAP MY TEETH SMARTLY BEFORE MY HEART FLEW OUT WHEN I 
SHAVED BY A FLUKE SOME INFERNAL SLY OLD SNAG THAT WOULD HAVE RIPPED THE 
LIFE OUT OF THE TINPOT STEAMBOAT AND DROWNED ALL THE PILGRIMS I HAD TO 
KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR THE SIGNS OF DEAD WOOD WE COULD CUT UP IN THE NIGHT 
FOR NEXT DAYS STEAMING WHEN YOU HAVE TO ATTEND TO THINGS OF THAT SORT 
TO THE MERE INCIDENTS OF THE SURFACE THE REALITYTHE REALITY I TELL 
YOUFADES THE INNER TRUTH IS HIDDENLUCKILY LUCKILY BUT I FELT IT 
ALL THE SAME I FELT OFTEN ITS MYSTERIOUS STILLNESS WATCHING ME AT 
MY MONKEY TRICKS JUST AS IT WATCHES YOU FELLOWS PERFORMING ON YOUR 
RESPECTIVE TIGHTROPES FORWHAT IS IT HALFACROWN A TUMBLE 
 
TRY TO BE CIVIL MARLOW GROWLED A VOICE AND I KNEW THERE WAS AT 
LEAST ONE LISTENER AWAKE BESIDES MYSELF 
 
I BEG YOUR PARDON I FORGOT THE HEARTACHE WHICH MAKES UP THE REST OF 
THE PRICE AND INDEED WHAT DOES THE PRICE MATTER IF THE TRICK BE WELL 
DONE YOU DO YOUR TRICKS VERY WELL AND I DIDNT DO BADLY EITHER SINCE 
I MANAGED NOT TO SINK THAT STEAMBOAT ON MY FIRST TRIP ITS A WONDER TO 
ME YET IMAGINE A BLINDFOLDED MAN SET TO DRIVE A VAN OVER A BAD ROAD 
I SWEATED AND SHIVERED OVER THAT BUSINESS CONSIDERABLY I CAN TELL 
YOU AFTER ALL FOR A SEAMAN TO SCRAPE THE BOTTOM OF THE THING THATS 
SUPPOSED TO FLOAT ALL THE TIME UNDER HIS CARE IS THE UNPARDONABLE SIN 
NO ONE MAY KNOW OF IT BUT YOU NEVER FORGET THE THUMPEH A BLOW ON THE 
VERY HEART YOU REMEMBER IT YOU DREAM OF IT YOU WAKE UP AT NIGHT AND 
THINK OF ITYEARS AFTERAND GO HOT AND COLD ALL OVER I DONT PRETEND 
TO SAY THAT STEAMBOAT FLOATED ALL THE TIME MORE THAN ONCE SHE HAD TO 
WADE FOR A BIT WITH TWENTY CANNIBALS SPLASHING AROUND AND PUSHING 
WE HAD ENLISTED SOME OF THESE CHAPS ON THE WAY FOR A CREW FINE 
FELLOWSCANNIBALSIN THEIR PLACE THEY WERE MEN ONE COULD WORK WITH 
AND I AM GRATEFUL TO THEM AND AFTER ALL THEY DID NOT EAT EACH OTHER 
BEFORE MY FACE THEY HAD BROUGHT ALONG A PROVISION OF HIPPOMEAT 
WHICH WENT ROTTEN AND MADE THE MYSTERY OF THE WILDERNESS STINK IN MY 
NOSTRILS PHOO I CAN SNIFF IT NOW I HAD THE MANAGER ON BOARD AND THREE 
OR FOUR PILGRIMS WITH THEIR STAVESALL COMPLETE SOMETIMES WE CAME UPON 
A STATION CLOSE BY THE BANK CLINGING TO THE SKIRTS OF THE UNKNOWN AND 
THE WHITE MEN RUSHING OUT OF A TUMBLEDOWN HOVEL WITH GREAT GESTURES OF 
JOY AND SURPRISE AND WELCOME SEEMED VERY STRANGEHAD THE APPEARANCE 
OF BEING HELD THERE CAPTIVE BY A SPELL THE WORD IVORY WOULD RING IN 
THE AIR FOR A WHILEAND ON WE WENT AGAIN INTO THE SILENCE ALONG EMPTY 
REACHES ROUND THE STILL BENDS BETWEEN THE HIGH WALLS OF OUR 
WINDING WAY REVERBERATING IN HOLLOW CLAPS THE PONDEROUS BEAT OF THE 
STERNWHEEL TREES TREES MILLIONS OF TREES MASSIVE IMMENSE RUNNING 
UP HIGH AND AT THEIR FOOT HUGGING THE BANK AGAINST THE STREAM CREPT 
THE LITTLE BEGRIMED STEAMBOAT LIKE A SLUGGISH BEETLE CRAWLING ON THE 
FLOOR OF A LOFTY PORTICO IT MADE YOU FEEL VERY SMALL VERY LOST AND 
YET IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER DEPRESSING THAT FEELING AFTER ALL IF YOU 
WERE SMALL THE GRIMY BEETLE CRAWLED ONWHICH WAS JUST WHAT YOU WANTED 
IT TO DO WHERE THE PILGRIMS IMAGINED IT CRAWLED TO I DONT KNOW 
TO SOME PLACE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO GET SOMETHING I BET FOR ME IT 
CRAWLED TOWARD KURTZEXCLUSIVELY BUT WHEN THE STEAMPIPES STARTED 
LEAKING WE CRAWLED VERY SLOW THE REACHES OPENED BEFORE US AND CLOSED 
BEHIND AS IF THE FOREST HAD STEPPED LEISURELY ACROSS THE WATER TO BAR 
THE WAY FOR OUR RETURN WE PENETRATED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE HEART 
OF DARKNESS IT WAS VERY QUIET THERE AT NIGHT SOMETIMES THE ROLL OF 
DRUMS BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF TREES WOULD RUN UP THE RIVER AND REMAIN 
SUSTAINED FAINTLY AS IF HOVERING IN THE AIR HIGH OVER OUR HEADS TILL 
THE FIRST BREAK OF DAY WHETHER IT MEANT WAR PEACE OR PRAYER WE COULD 
NOT TELL THE DAWNS WERE HERALDED BY THE DESCENT OF A CHILL STILLNESS 
THE WOODCUTTERS SLEPT THEIR FIRES BURNED LOW THE SNAPPING OF A TWIG 
WOULD MAKE YOU START WE WERE WANDERERS ON A PREHISTORIC EARTH ON AN 
EARTH THAT WORE THE ASPECT OF AN UNKNOWN PLANET WE COULD HAVE FANCIED 
OURSELVES THE FIRST OF MEN TAKING POSSESSION OF AN ACCURSED INHERITANCE 
TO BE SUBDUED AT THE COST OF PROFOUND ANGUISH AND OF EXCESSIVE TOIL BUT 
SUDDENLY AS WE STRUGGLED ROUND A BEND THERE WOULD BE A GLIMPSE OF RUSH 
WALLS OF PEAKED GRASSROOFS A BURST OF YELLS A WHIRL OF BLACK LIMBS 
A MASS OF HANDS CLAPPING OF FEET STAMPING OF BODIES SWAYING OF EYES 
ROLLING UNDER THE DROOP OF HEAVY AND MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE THE STEAMER 
TOILED ALONG SLOWLY ON THE EDGE OF A BLACK AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE FRENZY 
THE PREHISTORIC MAN WAS CURSING US PRAYING TO US WELCOMING USWHO 
COULD TELL WE WERE CUT OFF FROM THE COMPREHENSION OF OUR SURROUNDINGS 
WE GLIDED PAST LIKE PHANTOMS WONDERING AND SECRETLY APPALLED AS SANE 
MEN WOULD BE BEFORE AN ENTHUSIASTIC OUTBREAK IN A MADHOUSE WE COULD NOT 
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE WERE TOO FAR AND COULD NOT REMEMBER BECAUSE WE 
WERE TRAVELING IN THE NIGHT OF FIRST AGES OF THOSE AGES THAT ARE GONE 
LEAVING HARDLY A SIGNAND NO MEMORIES 
 
THE EARTH SEEMED UNEARTHLY WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK UPON THE SHACKLED 
FORM OF A CONQUERED MONSTER BUT THERETHERE YOU COULD LOOK AT A THING 
MONSTROUS AND FREE IT WAS UNEARTHLY AND THE MEN WERENO THEY WERE 
NOT INHUMAN WELL YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE WORST OF ITTHIS SUSPICION OF 
THEIR NOT BEING INHUMAN IT WOULD COME SLOWLY TO ONE THEY HOWLED AND 
LEAPED AND SPUN AND MADE HORRID FACES BUT WHAT THRILLED YOU WAS JUST 
THE THOUGHT OF THEIR HUMANITYLIKE YOURSTHE THOUGHT OF YOUR REMOTE 
KINSHIP WITH THIS WILD AND PASSIONATE UPROAR UGLY YES IT WAS UGLY 
ENOUGH BUT IF YOU WERE MAN ENOUGH YOU WOULD ADMIT TO YOURSELF THAT 
THERE WAS IN YOU JUST THE FAINTEST TRACE OF A RESPONSE TO THE TERRIBLE 
FRANKNESS OF THAT NOISE A DIM SUSPICION OF THERE BEING A MEANING IN IT 
WHICH YOUYOU SO REMOTE FROM THE NIGHT OF FIRST AGESCOULD COMPREHEND 
AND WHY NOT THE MIND OF MAN IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHINGBECAUSE EVERYTHING 
IS IN IT ALL THE PAST AS WELL AS ALL THE FUTURE WHAT WAS THERE AFTER 
ALL JOY FEAR SORROW DEVOTION VALOR RAGEWHO CAN TELLBUT 
TRUTHTRUTH STRIPPED OF ITS CLOAK OF TIME LET THE FOOL GAPE AND 
SHUDDERTHE MAN KNOWS AND CAN LOOK ON WITHOUT A WINK BUT HE MUST AT 
LEAST BE AS MUCH OF A MAN AS THESE ON THE SHORE HE MUST MEET THAT 
TRUTH WITH HIS OWN TRUE STUFFWITH HIS OWN INBORN STRENGTH PRINCIPLES 
PRINCIPLES WONT DO ACQUISITIONS CLOTHES PRETTY RAGSRAGS THAT WOULD 
FLY OFF AT THE FIRST GOOD SHAKE NO YOU WANT A DELIBERATE BELIEF AN 
APPEAL TO ME IN THIS FIENDISH ROWIS THERE VERY WELL I HEAR I ADMIT 
BUT I HAVE A VOICE TOO AND FOR GOOD OR EVIL MINE IS THE SPEECH THAT 
CANNOT BE SILENCED OF COURSE A FOOL WHAT WITH SHEER FRIGHT AND FINE 
SENTIMENTS IS ALWAYS SAFE WHOS THAT GRUNTING YOU WONDER I DIDNT GO 
ASHORE FOR A HOWL AND A DANCE WELL NOI DIDNT FINE SENTIMENTS YOU 
SAY FINE SENTIMENTS BE HANGED I HAD NO TIME I HAD TO MESS ABOUT WITH 
WHITELEAD AND STRIPS OF WOOLEN BLANKET HELPING TO PUT BANDAGES ON 
THOSE LEAKY STEAMPIPESI TELL YOU I HAD TO WATCH THE STEERING AND 
CIRCUMVENT THOSE SNAGS AND GET THE TINPOT ALONG BY HOOK OR BY CROOK 
THERE WAS SURFACETRUTH ENOUGH IN THESE THINGS TO SAVE A WISER MAN AND 
BETWEEN WHILES I HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE SAVAGE WHO WAS FIREMAN HE WAS 
AN IMPROVED SPECIMEN HE COULD FIRE UP A VERTICAL BOILER HE WAS THERE 
BELOW ME AND UPON MY WORD TO LOOK AT HIM WAS AS EDIFYING AS SEEING A 
DOG IN A PARODY OF BREECHES AND A FEATHER HAT WALKING ON HIS HINDLEGS 
A FEW MONTHS OF TRAINING HAD DONE FOR THAT REALLY FINE CHAP HE SQUINTED 
AT THE STEAMGAUGE AND AT THE WATERGAUGE WITH AN EVIDENT EFFORT OF 
INTREPIDITYAND HE HAD FILED TEETH TOO THE POOR DEVIL AND THE WOOL OF 
HIS PATE SHAVED INTO QUEER PATTERNS AND THREE ORNAMENTAL SCARS ON EACH 
OF HIS CHEEKS HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND STAMPING 
HIS FEET ON THE BANK INSTEAD OF WHICH HE WAS HARD AT WORK A THRALL TO 
STRANGE WITCHCRAFT FULL OF IMPROVING KNOWLEDGE HE WAS USEFUL BECAUSE 
HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED AND WHAT HE KNEW WAS THISTHAT SHOULD THE WATER 
IN THAT TRANSPARENT THING DISAPPEAR THE EVIL SPIRIT INSIDE THE BOILER 
WOULD GET ANGRY THROUGH THE GREATNESS OF HIS THIRST AND TAKE A TERRIBLE 
VENGEANCE SO HE SWEATED AND FIRED UP AND WATCHED THE GLASS FEARFULLY 
WITH AN IMPROMPTU CHARM MADE OF RAGS TIED TO HIS ARM AND A PIECE OF 
POLISHED BONE AS BIG AS A WATCH STUCK FLATWAYS THROUGH HIS LOWER LIP 
WHILE THE WOODED BANKS SLIPPED PAST US SLOWLY THE SHORT NOISE WAS LEFT 
BEHIND THE INTERMINABLE MILES OF SILENCEAND WE CREPT ON TOWARDS 
KURTZ BUT THE SNAGS WERE THICK THE WATER WAS TREACHEROUS AND SHALLOW 
THE BOILER SEEMED INDEED TO HAVE A SULKY DEVIL IN IT AND THUS NEITHER 
THAT FIREMAN NOR I HAD ANY TIME TO PEER INTO OUR CREEPY THOUGHTS 
 
SOME FIFTY MILES BELOW THE INNER STATION WE CAME UPON A HUT OF REEDS 
AN INCLINED AND MELANCHOLY POLE WITH THE UNRECOGNIZABLE TATTERS OF 
WHAT HAD BEEN A FLAG OF SOME SORT FLYING FROM IT AND A NEATLY STACKED 
WOODPILE THIS WAS UNEXPECTED WE CAME TO THE BANK AND ON THE STACK OF 
FIREWOOD FOUND A FLAT PIECE OF BOARD WITH SOME FADED PENCILWRITING 
ON IT WHEN DECIPHERED IT SAID WOOD FOR YOU HURRY UP APPROACH 
CAUTIOUSLY THERE WAS A SIGNATURE BUT IT WAS ILLEGIBLENOT 
KURTZA MUCH LONGER WORD HURRY UP WHERE UP THE RIVER APPROACH 
CAUTIOUSLY WE HAD NOT DONE SO BUT THE WARNING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
MEANT FOR THE PLACE WHERE IT COULD BE ONLY FOUND AFTER APPROACH 
SOMETHING WAS WRONG ABOVE BUT WHATAND HOW MUCH THAT WAS THE 
QUESTION WE COMMENTED ADVERSELY UPON THE IMBECILITY OF THAT TELEGRAPHIC 
STYLE THE BUSH AROUND SAID NOTHING AND WOULD NOT LET US LOOK VERY FAR 
EITHER A TORN CURTAIN OF RED TWILL HUNG IN THE DOORWAY OF THE HUT AND 
FLAPPED SADLY IN OUR FACES THE DWELLING WAS DISMANTLED BUT WE COULD 
SEE A WHITE MAN HAD LIVED THERE NOT VERY LONG AGO THERE REMAINED A RUDE 
TABLEA PLANK ON TWO POSTS A HEAP OF RUBBISH REPOSED IN A DARK CORNER 
AND BY THE DOOR I PICKED UP A BOOK IT HAD LOST ITS COVERS AND THE 
PAGES HAD BEEN THUMBED INTO A STATE OF EXTREMELY DIRTY SOFTNESS BUT THE 
BACK HAD BEEN LOVINGLY STITCHED AFRESH WITH WHITE COTTON THREAD WHICH 
LOOKED CLEAN YET IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FIND ITS TITLE WAS AN 
INQUIRY INTO SOME POINTS OF SEAMANSHIP BY A MAN TOWER TOWSONSOME 
SUCH NAMEMASTER IN HIS MAJESTYS NAVY THE MATTER LOOKED DREARY 
READING ENOUGH WITH ILLUSTRATIVE DIAGRAMS AND REPULSIVE TABLES OF 
FIGURES AND THE COPY WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD I HANDLED THIS AMAZING 
ANTIQUITY WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE TENDERNESS LEST IT SHOULD DISSOLVE 
IN MY HANDS WITHIN TOWSON OR TOWSER WAS INQUIRING EARNESTLY INTO THE 
BREAKING STRAIN OF SHIPS CHAINS AND TACKLE AND OTHER SUCH MATTERS NOT 
A VERY ENTHRALLING BOOK BUT AT THE FIRST GLANCE YOU COULD SEE THERE A 
SINGLENESS OF INTENTION AN HONEST CONCERN FOR THE RIGHT WAY OF GOING 
TO WORK WHICH MADE THESE HUMBLE PAGES THOUGHT OUT SO MANY YEARS AGO 
LUMINOUS WITH ANOTHER THAN A PROFESSIONAL LIGHT THE SIMPLE OLD SAILOR 
WITH HIS TALK OF CHAINS AND PURCHASES MADE ME FORGET THE JUNGLE AND 
THE PILGRIMS IN A DELICIOUS SENSATION OF HAVING COME UPON SOMETHING 
UNMISTAKABLY REAL SUCH A BOOK BEING THERE WAS WONDERFUL ENOUGH BUT 
STILL MORE ASTOUNDING WERE THE NOTES PENCILED IN THE MARGIN AND PLAINLY 
REFERRING TO THE TEXT I COULDNT BELIEVE MY EYES THEY WERE IN CIPHER 
YES IT LOOKED LIKE CIPHER FANCY A MAN LUGGING WITH HIM A BOOK OF THAT 
DESCRIPTION INTO THIS NOWHERE AND STUDYING ITAND MAKING NOTESIN 
CIPHER AT THAT IT WAS AN EXTRAVAGANT MYSTERY 
 
I HAD BEEN DIMLY AWARE FOR SOME TIME OF A WORRYING NOISE AND WHEN I 
LIFTED MY EYES I SAW THE WOODPILE WAS GONE AND THE MANAGER AIDED BY 
ALL THE PILGRIMS WAS SHOUTING AT ME FROM THE RIVERSIDE I SLIPPED THE 
BOOK INTO MY POCKET I ASSURE YOU TO LEAVE OFF READING WAS LIKE TEARING 
MYSELF AWAY FROM THE SHELTER OF AN OLD AND SOLID FRIENDSHIP 
 
I STARTED THE LAME ENGINE AHEAD IT MUST BE THIS MISERABLE 
TRADERTHIS INTRUDER EXCLAIMED THE MANAGER LOOKING BACK MALEVOLENTLY 
AT THE PLACE WE HAD LEFT HE MUST BE ENGLISH I SAID IT WILL NOT 
SAVE HIM FROM GETTING INTO TROUBLE IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL MUTTERED THE 
MANAGER DARKLY I OBSERVED WITH ASSUMED INNOCENCE THAT NO MAN WAS SAFE 
FROM TROUBLE IN THIS WORLD 
 
THE CURRENT WAS MORE RAPID NOW THE STEAMER SEEMED AT HER LAST GASP 
THE STERNWHEEL FLOPPED LANGUIDLY AND I CAUGHT MYSELF LISTENING ON 
TIPTOE FOR THE NEXT BEAT OF THE BOAT FOR IN SOBER TRUTH I EXPECTED THE 
WRETCHED THING TO GIVE UP EVERY MOMENT IT WAS LIKE WATCHING THE LAST 
FLICKERS OF A LIFE BUT STILL WE CRAWLED SOMETIMES I WOULD PICK OUT A 
TREE A LITTLE WAY AHEAD TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS KURTZ BY BUT 
I LOST IT INVARIABLY BEFORE WE GOT ABREAST TO KEEP THE EYES SO LONG 
ON ONE THING WAS TOO MUCH FOR HUMAN PATIENCE THE MANAGER DISPLAYED 
A BEAUTIFUL RESIGNATION I FRETTED AND FUMED AND TOOK TO ARGUING WITH 
MYSELF WHETHER OR NO I WOULD TALK OPENLY WITH KURTZ BUT BEFORE I COULD 
COME TO ANY CONCLUSION IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MY SPEECH OR MY SILENCE 
INDEED ANY ACTION OF MINE WOULD BE A MERE FUTILITY WHAT DID IT MATTER 
WHAT ANYONE KNEW OR IGNORED WHAT DID IT MATTER WHO WAS MANAGER ONE 
GETS SOMETIMES SUCH A FLASH OF INSIGHT THE ESSENTIALS OF THIS AFFAIR 
LAY DEEP UNDER THE SURFACE BEYOND MY REACH AND BEYOND MY POWER OF 
MEDDLING 
 
TOWARDS THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY WE JUDGED OURSELVES ABOUT EIGHT 
MILES FROM KURTZS STATION I WANTED TO PUSH ON BUT THE MANAGER LOOKED 
GRAVE AND TOLD ME THE NAVIGATION UP THERE WAS SO DANGEROUS THAT IT 
WOULD BE ADVISABLE THE SUN BEING VERY LOW ALREADY TO WAIT WHERE WE 
WERE TILL NEXT MORNING MOREOVER HE POINTED OUT THAT IF THE WARNING 
TO APPROACH CAUTIOUSLY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED WE MUST APPROACH IN 
DAYLIGHTNOT AT DUSK OR IN THE DARK THIS WAS SENSIBLE ENOUGH EIGHT 
MILES MEANT NEARLY THREE HOURS STEAMING FOR US AND I COULD ALSO SEE 
SUSPICIOUS RIPPLES AT THE UPPER END OF THE REACH NEVERTHELESS I WAS 
ANNOYED BEYOND EXPRESSION AT THE DELAY AND MOST UNREASONABLY TOO SINCE 
ONE NIGHT MORE COULD NOT MATTER MUCH AFTER SO MANY MONTHS AS WE HAD 
PLENTY OF WOOD AND CAUTION WAS THE WORD I BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE STREAM THE REACH WAS NARROW STRAIGHT WITH HIGH SIDES LIKE A 
RAILWAY CUTTING THE DUSK CAME GLIDING INTO IT LONG BEFORE THE SUN HAD 
SET THE CURRENT RAN SMOOTH AND SWIFT BUT A DUMB IMMOBILITY SAT ON 
THE BANKS THE LIVING TREES LASHED TOGETHER BY THE CREEPERS AND EVERY 
LIVING BUSH OF THE UNDERGROWTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHANGED INTO STONE 
EVEN TO THE SLENDEREST TWIG TO THE LIGHTEST LEAF IT WAS NOT SLEEPIT 
SEEMED UNNATURAL LIKE A STATE OF TRANCE NOT THE FAINTEST SOUND OF ANY 
KIND COULD BE HEARD YOU LOOKED ON AMAZED AND BEGAN TO SUSPECT YOURSELF 
OF BEING DEAFTHEN THE NIGHT CAME SUDDENLY AND STRUCK YOU BLIND AS 
WELL ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING SOME LARGE FISH LEAPED AND THE LOUD 
SPLASH MADE ME JUMP AS THOUGH A GUN HAD BEEN FIRED WHEN THE SUN ROSE 
THERE WAS A WHITE FOG VERY WARM AND CLAMMY AND MORE BLINDING THAN THE 
NIGHT IT DID NOT SHIFT OR DRIVE IT WAS JUST THERE STANDING ALL ROUND 
YOU LIKE SOMETHING SOLID AT EIGHT OR NINE PERHAPS IT LIFTED AS A 
SHUTTER LIFTS WE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE TOWERING MULTITUDE OF TREES 
OF THE IMMENSE MATTED JUNGLE WITH THE BLAZING LITTLE BALL OF THE SUN 
HANGING OVER ITALL PERFECTLY STILLAND THEN THE WHITE SHUTTER CAME 
DOWN AGAIN SMOOTHLY AS IF SLIDING IN GREASED GROOVES I ORDERED THE 
CHAIN WHICH WE HAD BEGUN TO HEAVE IN TO BE PAID OUT AGAIN BEFORE IT 
STOPPED RUNNING WITH A MUFFLED RATTLE A CRY A VERY LOUD CRY AS OF 
INFINITE DESOLATION SOARED SLOWLY IN THE OPAQUE AIR IT CEASED A 
COMPLAINING CLAMOR MODULATED IN SAVAGE DISCORDS FILLED OUR EARS THE 
SHEER UNEXPECTEDNESS OF IT MADE MY HAIR STIR UNDER MY CAP I DONT KNOW 
HOW IT STRUCK THE OTHERS TO ME IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE MIST ITSELF HAD 
SCREAMED SO SUDDENLY AND APPARENTLY FROM ALL SIDES AT ONCE DID 
THIS TUMULTUOUS AND MOURNFUL UPROAR ARISE IT CULMINATED IN A HURRIED 
OUTBREAK OF ALMOST INTOLERABLY EXCESSIVE SHRIEKING WHICH STOPPED SHORT 
LEAVING US STIFFENED IN A VARIETY OF SILLY ATTITUDES AND OBSTINATELY 
LISTENING TO THE NEARLY AS APPALLING AND EXCESSIVE SILENCE GOOD GOD 
WHAT IS THE MEANING STAMMERED AT MY ELBOW ONE OF THE PILGRIMSA 
LITTLE FAT MAN WITH SANDY HAIR AND RED WHISKERS WHO WORE SIDESPRING 
BOOTS AND PINK PYJAMAS TUCKED INTO HIS SOCKS TWO OTHERS REMAINED 
OPENMOUTHED A WHOLE MINUTE THEN DASHED INTO THE LITTLE CABIN TO RUSH 
OUT INCONTINENTLY AND STAND DARTING SCARED GLANCES WITH WINCHESTERS AT 
READY IN THEIR HANDS WHAT WE COULD SEE WAS JUST THE STEAMER WE 
WERE ON HER OUTLINES BLURRED AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF 
DISSOLVING AND A MISTY STRIP OF WATER PERHAPS TWO FEET BROAD AROUND 
HERAND THAT WAS ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS NOWHERE AS FAR AS OUR 
EYES AND EARS WERE CONCERNED JUST NOWHERE GONE DISAPPEARED SWEPT OFF 
WITHOUT LEAVING A WHISPER OR A SHADOW BEHIND 
 
I WENT FORWARD AND ORDERED THE CHAIN TO BE HAULED IN SHORT SO AS TO 
BE READY TO TRIP THE ANCHOR AND MOVE THE STEAMBOAT AT ONCE IF NECESSARY 
WILL THEY ATTACK WHISPERED AN AWED VOICE WE WILL ALL BE BUTCHERED 
IN THIS FOG MURMURED ANOTHER THE FACES TWITCHED WITH THE STRAIN THE 
HANDS TREMBLED SLIGHTLY THE EYES FORGOT TO WINK IT WAS VERY CURIOUS 
TO SEE THE CONTRAST OF EXPRESSIONS OF THE WHITE MEN AND OF THE BLACK 
FELLOWS OF OUR CREW WHO WERE AS MUCH STRANGERS TO THAT PART OF THE 
RIVER AS WE THOUGH THEIR HOMES WERE ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED MILES AWAY THE 
WHITES OF COURSE GREATLY DISCOMPOSED HAD BESIDES A CURIOUS LOOK OF 
BEING PAINFULLY SHOCKED BY SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUS ROW THE OTHERS HAD AN 
ALERT NATURALLY INTERESTED EXPRESSION BUT THEIR FACES WERE ESSENTIALLY 
QUIET EVEN THOSE OF THE ONE OR TWO WHO GRINNED AS THEY HAULED AT THE 
CHAIN SEVERAL EXCHANGED SHORT GRUNTING PHRASES WHICH SEEMED TO SETTLE 
THE MATTER TO THEIR SATISFACTION THEIR HEADMAN A YOUNG BROADCHESTED 
BLACK SEVERELY DRAPED IN DARKBLUE FRINGED CLOTHS WITH FIERCE NOSTRILS 
AND HIS HAIR ALL DONE UP ARTFULLY IN OILY RINGLETS STOOD NEAR ME 
AHA I SAID JUST FOR GOOD FELLOWSHIPS SAKE CATCH IM HE SNAPPED 
WITH A BLOODSHOT WIDENING OF HIS EYES AND A FLASH OF SHARP TEETHCATCH 
IM GIVE IM TO US TO YOU EH I ASKED WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH 
THEM EAT IM HE SAID CURTLY AND LEANING HIS ELBOW ON THE RAIL 
LOOKED OUT INTO THE FOG IN A DIGNIFIED AND PROFOUNDLY PENSIVE ATTITUDE 
I WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY HORRIFIED HAD IT NOT OCCURRED TO 
ME THAT HE AND HIS CHAPS MUST BE VERY HUNGRY THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN 
GROWING INCREASINGLY HUNGRY FOR AT LEAST THIS MONTH PAST THEY HAD BEEN 
ENGAGED FOR SIX MONTHS I DONT THINK A SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAD ANY 
CLEAR IDEA OF TIME AS WE AT THE END OF COUNTLESS AGES HAVE THEY STILL 
BELONGED TO THE BEGINNINGS OF TIMEHAD NO INHERITED EXPERIENCE TO TEACH 
THEM AS IT WERE AND OF COURSE AS LONG AS THERE WAS A PIECE OF PAPER 
WRITTEN OVER IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOME FARCICAL LAW OR OTHER MADE DOWN THE 
RIVER IT DIDNT ENTER ANYBODYS HEAD TO TROUBLE HOW THEY WOULD LIVE 
CERTAINLY THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM SOME ROTTEN HIPPOMEAT WHICH 
COULDNT HAVE LASTED VERY LONG ANYWAY EVEN IF THE PILGRIMS HADNT IN 
THE MIDST OF A SHOCKING HULLABALOO THROWN A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF IT 
OVERBOARD IT LOOKED LIKE A HIGHHANDED PROCEEDING BUT IT WAS REALLY 
A CASE OF LEGITIMATE SELFDEFENSE YOU CANT BREATHE DEAD HIPPO WAKING 
SLEEPING AND EATING AND AT THE SAME TIME KEEP YOUR PRECARIOUS GRIP ON 
EXISTENCE BESIDES THAT THEY HAD GIVEN THEM EVERY WEEK THREE PIECES OF 
BRASS WIRE EACH ABOUT NINE INCHES LONG AND THE THEORY WAS THEY WERE TO 
BUY THEIR PROVISIONS WITH THAT CURRENCY IN RIVERSIDE VILLAGES YOU CAN 
SEE HOW THAT WORKED THERE WERE EITHER NO VILLAGES OR THE PEOPLE WERE 
HOSTILE OR THE DIRECTOR WHO LIKE THE REST OF US FED OUT OF TINS WITH 
AN OCCASIONAL OLD HEGOAT THROWN IN DIDNT WANT TO STOP THE STEAMER FOR 
SOME MORE OR LESS RECONDITE REASON SO UNLESS THEY SWALLOWED THE WIRE 
ITSELF OR MADE LOOPS OF IT TO SNARE THE FISHES WITH I DONT SEE WHAT 
GOOD THEIR EXTRAVAGANT SALARY COULD BE TO THEM I MUST SAY IT WAS PAID 
WITH A REGULARITY WORTHY OF A LARGE AND HONORABLE TRADING COMPANY FOR 
THE REST THE ONLY THING TO EATTHOUGH IT DIDNT LOOK EATABLE IN THE 
LEASTI SAW IN THEIR POSSESSION WAS A FEW LUMPS OF SOME STUFF LIKE 
HALFCOOKED DOUGH OF A DIRTY LAVENDER COLOR THEY KEPT WRAPPED IN 
LEAVES AND NOW AND THEN SWALLOWED A PIECE OF BUT SO SMALL THAT IT 
SEEMED DONE MORE FOR THE LOOKS OF THE THING THAN FOR ANY SERIOUS PURPOSE 
OF SUSTENANCE WHY IN THE NAME OF ALL THE GNAWING DEVILS OF HUNGER THEY 
DIDNT GO FOR USTHEY WERE THIRTY TO FIVEAND HAVE A GOOD TUCK IN FOR 
ONCE AMAZES ME NOW WHEN I THINK OF IT THEY WERE BIG POWERFUL MEN 
WITH NOT MUCH CAPACITY TO WEIGH THE CONSEQUENCES WITH COURAGE WITH 
STRENGTH EVEN YET THOUGH THEIR SKINS WERE NO LONGER GLOSSY AND THEIR 
MUSCLES NO LONGER HARD AND I SAW THAT SOMETHING RESTRAINING ONE OF 
THOSE HUMAN SECRETS THAT BAFFLE PROBABILITY HAD COME INTO PLAY THERE 
I LOOKED AT THEM WITH A SWIFT QUICKENING OF INTERESTNOT BECAUSE IT 
OCCURRED TO ME I MIGHT BE EATEN BY THEM BEFORE VERY LONG THOUGH I 
OWN TO YOU THAT JUST THEN I PERCEIVEDIN A NEW LIGHT AS IT WEREHOW 
UNWHOLESOME THE PILGRIMS LOOKED AND I HOPED YES I POSITIVELY HOPED 
THAT MY ASPECT WAS NOT SOWHAT SHALL I SAYSOUNAPPETIZING A TOUCH 
OF FANTASTIC VANITY WHICH FITTED WELL WITH THE DREAMSENSATION THAT 
PERVADED ALL MY DAYS AT THAT TIME PERHAPS I HAD A LITTLE FEVER TOO ONE 
CANT LIVE WITH ONES FINGER EVERLASTINGLY ON ONES PULSE I HAD 
OFTEN A LITTLE FEVER OR A LITTLE TOUCH OF OTHER THINGSTHE PLAYFUL 
PAWSTROKES OF THE WILDERNESS THE PRELIMINARY TRIFLING BEFORE THE MORE 
SERIOUS ONSLAUGHT WHICH CAME IN DUE COURSE YES I LOOKED AT THEM AS YOU 
WOULD ON ANY HUMAN BEING WITH A CURIOSITY OF THEIR IMPULSES MOTIVES 
CAPACITIES WEAKNESSES WHEN BROUGHT TO THE TEST OF AN INEXORABLE 
PHYSICAL NECESSITY RESTRAINT WHAT POSSIBLE RESTRAINT WAS IT 
SUPERSTITION DISGUST PATIENCE FEAROR SOME KIND OF PRIMITIVE HONOR 
NO FEAR CAN STAND UP TO HUNGER NO PATIENCE CAN WEAR IT OUT DISGUST 
SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST WHERE HUNGER IS AND AS TO SUPERSTITION BELIEFS 
AND WHAT YOU MAY CALL PRINCIPLES THEY ARE LESS THAN CHAFF IN A BREEZE 
DONT YOU KNOW THE DEVILRY OF LINGERING STARVATION ITS EXASPERATING 
TORMENT ITS BLACK THOUGHTS ITS SOMBER AND BROODING FEROCITY WELL 
I DO IT TAKES A MAN ALL HIS INBORN STRENGTH TO FIGHT HUNGER PROPERLY 
ITS REALLY EASIER TO FACE BEREAVEMENT DISHONOR AND THE PERDITION OF 
ONES SOULTHAN THIS KIND OF PROLONGED HUNGER SAD BUT TRUE AND THESE 
CHAPS TOO HAD NO EARTHLY REASON FOR ANY KIND OF SCRUPLE RESTRAINT I 
WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE EXPECTED RESTRAINT FROM A HYENA PROWLING AMONGST 
THE CORPSES OF A BATTLEFIELD BUT THERE WAS THE FACT FACING METHE FACT 
DAZZLING TO BE SEEN LIKE THE FOAM ON THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA LIKE A 
RIPPLE ON AN UNFATHOMABLE ENIGMA A MYSTERY GREATERWHEN I THOUGHT 
OF ITTHAN THE CURIOUS INEXPLICABLE NOTE OF DESPERATE GRIEF IN THIS 
SAVAGE CLAMOR THAT HAD SWEPT BY US ON THE RIVERBANK BEHIND THE BLIND 
WHITENESS OF THE FOG 
 
TWO PILGRIMS WERE QUARRELING IN HURRIED WHISPERS AS TO WHICH BANK 
LEFT NO NO HOW CAN YOU RIGHT RIGHT OF COURSE IT IS VERY 
SERIOUS SAID THE MANAGERS VOICE BEHIND ME I WOULD BE DESOLATED IF 
ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO MR KURTZ BEFORE WE CAME UP I LOOKED AT HIM 
AND HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT HE WAS SINCERE HE WAS JUST THE KIND OF 
MAN WHO WOULD WISH TO PRESERVE APPEARANCES THAT WAS HIS RESTRAINT BUT 
WHEN HE MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT GOING ON AT ONCE I DID NOT EVEN TAKE 
THE TROUBLE TO ANSWER HIM I KNEW AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
WERE WE TO LET GO OUR HOLD OF THE BOTTOM WE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IN 
THE AIRIN SPACE WE WOULDNT BE ABLE TO TELL WHERE WE WERE GOING 
TOWHETHER UP OR DOWN STREAM OR ACROSSTILL WE FETCHED AGAINST ONE 
BANK OR THE OTHERAND THEN WE WOULDNT KNOW AT FIRST WHICH IT WAS 
OF COURSE I MADE NO MOVE I HAD NO MIND FOR A SMASHUP YOU COULDNT 
IMAGINE A MORE DEADLY PLACE FOR A SHIPWRECK WHETHER DROWNED AT ONCE OR 
NOT WE WERE SURE TO PERISH SPEEDILY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I AUTHORIZE 
YOU TO TAKE ALL THE RISKS HE SAID AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I REFUSE TO 
TAKE ANY I SAID SHORTLY WHICH WAS JUST THE ANSWER HE EXPECTED THOUGH 
ITS TONE MIGHT HAVE SURPRISED HIM WELL I MUST DEFER TO YOUR JUDGMENT 
YOU ARE CAPTAIN HE SAID WITH MARKED CIVILITY I TURNED MY SHOULDER TO 
HIM IN SIGN OF MY APPRECIATION AND LOOKED INTO THE FOG HOW LONG WOULD 
IT LAST IT WAS THE MOST HOPELESS LOOKOUT THE APPROACH TO THIS KURTZ 
GRUBBING FOR IVORY IN THE WRETCHED BUSH WAS BESET BY AS MANY DANGERS AS 
THOUGH HE HAD BEEN AN ENCHANTED PRINCESS SLEEPING IN A FABULOUS CASTLE 
WILL THEY ATTACK DO YOU THINK ASKED THE MANAGER IN A CONFIDENTIAL 
TONE 
 
I DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD ATTACK FOR SEVERAL OBVIOUS REASONS THE 
THICK FOG WAS ONE IF THEY LEFT THE BANK IN THEIR CANOES THEY WOULD GET 
LOST IN IT AS WE WOULD BE IF WE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE STILL I HAD ALSO 
JUDGED THE JUNGLE OF BOTH BANKS QUITE IMPENETRABLEAND YET EYES WERE 
IN IT EYES THAT HAD SEEN US THE RIVERSIDE BUSHES WERE CERTAINLY VERY 
THICK BUT THE UNDERGROWTH BEHIND WAS EVIDENTLY PENETRABLE 
HOWEVER DURING THE SHORT LIFT I HAD SEEN NO CANOES ANYWHERE IN THE 
REACHCERTAINLY NOT ABREAST OF THE STEAMER BUT WHAT MADE THE IDEA OF 
ATTACK INCONCEIVABLE TO ME WAS THE NATURE OF THE NOISEOF THE CRIES WE 
HAD HEARD THEY HAD NOT THE FIERCE CHARACTER BODING OF IMMEDIATE HOSTILE 
INTENTION UNEXPECTED WILD AND VIOLENT AS THEY HAD BEEN THEY HAD 
GIVEN ME AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPRESSION OF SORROW THE GLIMPSE OF THE 
STEAMBOAT HAD FOR SOME REASON FILLED THOSE SAVAGES WITH UNRESTRAINED 
GRIEF THE DANGER IF ANY I EXPOUNDED WAS FROM OUR PROXIMITY TO A 
GREAT HUMAN PASSION LET LOOSE EVEN EXTREME GRIEF MAY ULTIMATELY VENT 
ITSELF IN VIOLENCEBUT MORE GENERALLY TAKES THE FORM OF APATHY    
 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE PILGRIMS STARE THEY HAD NO HEART TO GRIN OR 
EVEN TO REVILE ME BUT I BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT ME GONE MADWITH FRIGHT 
MAYBE I DELIVERED A REGULAR LECTURE MY DEAR BOYS IT WAS NO GOOD 
BOTHERING KEEP A LOOKOUT WELL YOU MAY GUESS I WATCHED THE FOG FOR 
THE SIGNS OF LIFTING AS A CAT WATCHES A MOUSE BUT FOR ANYTHING ELSE OUR 
EYES WERE OF NO MORE USE TO US THAN IF WE HAD BEEN BURIED MILES DEEP 
IN A HEAP OF COTTONWOOL IT FELT LIKE IT TOOCHOKING WARM STIFLING 
BESIDES ALL I SAID THOUGH IT SOUNDED EXTRAVAGANT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
TRUE TO FACT WHAT WE AFTERWARDS ALLUDED TO AS AN ATTACK WAS REALLY AN 
ATTEMPT AT REPULSE THE ACTION WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AGGRESSIVEIT 
WAS NOT EVEN DEFENSIVE IN THE USUAL SENSE IT WAS UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE 
STRESS OF DESPERATION AND IN ITS ESSENCE WAS PURELY PROTECTIVE 
 
IT DEVELOPED ITSELF I SHOULD SAY TWO HOURS AFTER THE FOG LIFTED AND 
ITS COMMENCEMENT WAS AT A SPOT ROUGHLY SPEAKING ABOUT A MILE AND A 
HALF BELOW KURTZS STATION WE HAD JUST FLOUNDERED AND FLOPPED ROUND A 
BEND WHEN I SAW AN ISLET A MERE GRASSY HUMMOCK OF BRIGHT GREEN IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM IT WAS THE ONLY THING OF THE KIND BUT AS WE 
OPENED THE REACH MORE I PERCEIVED IT WAS THE HEAD OF A LONG SANDBANK 
OR RATHER OF A CHAIN OF SHALLOW PATCHES STRETCHING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE RIVER THEY WERE DISCOLORED JUST AWASH AND THE WHOLE LOT WAS SEEN 
JUST UNDER THE WATER EXACTLY AS A MANS BACKBONE IS SEEN RUNNING DOWN 
THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK UNDER THE SKIN NOW AS FAR AS I DID SEE I COULD 
GO TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT OF THIS I DIDNT KNOW EITHER CHANNEL OF 
COURSE THE BANKS LOOKED PRETTY WELL ALIKE THE DEPTH APPEARED THE SAME 
BUT AS I HAD BEEN INFORMED THE STATION WAS ON THE WEST SIDE I NATURALLY 
HEADED FOR THE WESTERN PASSAGE 
 
NO SOONER HAD WE FAIRLY ENTERED IT THAN I BECAME AWARE IT WAS MUCH 
NARROWER THAN I HAD SUPPOSED TO THE LEFT OF US THERE WAS THE LONG 
UNINTERRUPTED SHOAL AND TO THE RIGHT A HIGH STEEP BANK HEAVILY 
OVERGROWN WITH BUSHES ABOVE THE BUSH THE TREES STOOD IN SERRIED RANKS 
THE TWIGS OVERHUNG THE CURRENT THICKLY AND FROM DISTANCE TO DISTANCE A 
LARGE LIMB OF SOME TREE PROJECTED RIGIDLY OVER THE STREAM IT WAS THEN 
WELL ON IN THE AFTERNOON THE FACE OF THE FOREST WAS GLOOMY AND A 
BROAD STRIP OF SHADOW HAD ALREADY FALLEN ON THE WATER IN THIS SHADOW 
WE STEAMED UPVERY SLOWLY AS YOU MAY IMAGINE I SHEERED HER WELL 
INSHORETHE WATER BEING DEEPEST NEAR THE BANK AS THE SOUNDINGPOLE 
INFORMED ME 
 
ONE OF MY HUNGRY AND FORBEARING FRIENDS WAS SOUNDING IN THE BOWS JUST 
BELOW ME THIS STEAMBOAT WAS EXACTLY LIKE A DECKED SCOW ON THE DECK 
THERE WERE TWO LITTLE TEAKWOOD HOUSES WITH DOORS AND WINDOWS THE 
BOILER WAS IN THE FOREEND AND THE MACHINERY RIGHT ASTERN OVER THE 
WHOLE THERE WAS A LIGHT ROOF SUPPORTED ON STANCHIONS THE FUNNEL 
PROJECTED THROUGH THAT ROOF AND IN FRONT OF THE FUNNEL A SMALL CABIN 
BUILT OF LIGHT PLANKS SERVED FOR A PILOTHOUSE IT CONTAINED A COUCH 
TWO CAMPSTOOLS A LOADED MARTINIHENRY LEANING IN ONE CORNER A TINY 
TABLE AND THE STEERINGWHEEL IT HAD A WIDE DOOR IN FRONT AND A BROAD 
SHUTTER AT EACH SIDE ALL THESE WERE ALWAYS THROWN OPEN OF COURSE I 
SPENT MY DAYS PERCHED UP THERE ON THE EXTREME FOREEND OF THAT ROOF 
BEFORE THE DOOR AT NIGHT I SLEPT OR TRIED TO ON THE COUCH AN 
ATHLETIC BLACK BELONGING TO SOME COAST TRIBE AND EDUCATED BY MY POOR 
PREDECESSOR WAS THE HELMSMAN HE SPORTED A PAIR OF BRASS EARRINGS WORE 
A BLUE CLOTH WRAPPER FROM THE WAIST TO THE ANKLES AND THOUGHT ALL THE 
WORLD OF HIMSELF HE WAS THE MOST UNSTABLE KIND OF FOOL I HAD EVER SEEN 
HE STEERED WITH NO END OF A SWAGGER WHILE YOU WERE BY BUT IF HE LOST 
SIGHT OF YOU HE BECAME INSTANTLY THE PREY OF AN ABJECT FUNK AND WOULD 
LET THAT CRIPPLE OF A STEAMBOAT GET THE UPPER HAND OF HIM IN A MINUTE 
 
I WAS LOOKING DOWN AT THE SOUNDINGPOLE AND FEELING MUCH ANNOYED TO 
SEE AT EACH TRY A LITTLE MORE OF IT STICK OUT OF THAT RIVER WHEN I SAW 
MY POLEMAN GIVE UP THE BUSINESS SUDDENLY AND STRETCH HIMSELF FLAT ON 
THE DECK WITHOUT EVEN TAKING THE TROUBLE TO HAUL HIS POLE IN HE KEPT 
HOLD ON IT THOUGH AND IT TRAILED IN THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME THE 
FIREMAN WHOM I COULD ALSO SEE BELOW ME SAT DOWN ABRUPTLY BEFORE HIS 
FURNACE AND DUCKED HIS HEAD I WAS AMAZED THEN I HAD TO LOOK AT THE 
RIVER MIGHTY QUICK BECAUSE THERE WAS A SNAG IN THE FAIRWAY STICKS 
LITTLE STICKS WERE FLYING ABOUTTHICK THEY WERE WHIZZING BEFORE MY 
NOSE DROPPING BELOW ME STRIKING BEHIND ME AGAINST MY PILOTHOUSE ALL 
THIS TIME THE RIVER THE SHORE THE WOODS WERE VERY QUIETPERFECTLY 
QUIET I COULD ONLY HEAR THE HEAVY SPLASHING THUMP OF THE STERNWHEEL 
AND THE PATTER OF THESE THINGS WE CLEARED THE SNAG CLUMSILY ARROWS BY 
JOVE WE WERE BEING SHOT AT I STEPPED IN QUICKLY TO CLOSE THE SHUTTER 
ON THE LAND SIDE THAT FOOLHELMSMAN HIS HANDS ON THE SPOKES WAS 
LIFTING HIS KNEES HIGH STAMPING HIS FEET CHAMPING HIS MOUTH LIKE A 
REINEDIN HORSE CONFOUND HIM AND WE WERE STAGGERING WITHIN TEN FEET OF 
THE BANK I HAD TO LEAN RIGHT OUT TO SWING THE HEAVY SHUTTER AND I SAW 
A FACE AMONGST THE LEAVES ON THE LEVEL WITH MY OWN LOOKING AT ME VERY 
FIERCE AND STEADY AND THEN SUDDENLY AS THOUGH A VEIL HAD BEEN REMOVED 
FROM MY EYES I MADE OUT DEEP IN THE TANGLED GLOOM NAKED BREASTS 
ARMS LEGS GLARING EYESTHE BUSH WAS SWARMING WITH HUMAN LIMBS IN 
MOVEMENT GLISTENING OF BRONZE COLOR THE TWIGS SHOOK SWAYED AND 
RUSTLED THE ARROWS FLEW OUT OF THEM AND THEN THE SHUTTER CAME TO 
STEER HER STRAIGHT I SAID TO THE HELMSMAN HE HELD HIS HEAD RIGID 
FACE FORWARD BUT HIS EYES ROLLED HE KEPT ON LIFTING AND SETTING DOWN 
HIS FEET GENTLY HIS MOUTH FOAMED A LITTLE KEEP QUIET I SAID IN A 
FURY I MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE ORDERED A TREE NOT TO SWAY IN THE WIND 
I DARTED OUT BELOW ME THERE WAS A GREAT SCUFFLE OF FEET ON THE IRON 
DECK CONFUSED EXCLAMATIONS A VOICE SCREAMED CAN YOU TURN BACK 
I CAUGHT SHAPE OF A VSHAPED RIPPLE ON THE WATER AHEAD WHAT ANOTHER 
SNAG A FUSILLADE BURST OUT UNDER MY FEET THE PILGRIMS HAD OPENED WITH 
THEIR WINCHESTERS AND WERE SIMPLY SQUIRTING LEAD INTO THAT BUSH A 
DEUCE OF A LOT OF SMOKE CAME UP AND DROVE SLOWLY FORWARD I SWORE AT 
IT NOW I COULDNT SEE THE RIPPLE OR THE SNAG EITHER I STOOD IN THE 
DOORWAY PEERING AND THE ARROWS CAME IN SWARMS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
POISONED BUT THEY LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WOULDNT KILL A CAT THE BUSH 
BEGAN TO HOWL OUR WOODCUTTERS RAISED A WARLIKE WHOOP THE REPORT OF A 
RIFLE JUST AT MY BACK DEAFENED ME I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND THE 
PILOTHOUSE WAS YET FULL OF NOISE AND SMOKE WHEN I MADE A DASH AT THE 
WHEEL THE FOOLNIGGER HAD DROPPED EVERYTHING TO THROW THE SHUTTER 
OPEN AND LET OFF THAT MARTINIHENRY HE STOOD BEFORE THE WIDE OPENING 
GLARING AND I YELLED AT HIM TO COME BACK WHILE I STRAIGHTENED THE 
SUDDEN TWIST OUT OF THAT STEAMBOAT THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TURN EVEN IF I 
HAD WANTED TO THE SNAG WAS SOMEWHERE VERY NEAR AHEAD IN THAT CONFOUNDED 
SMOKE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE SO I JUST CROWDED HER INTO THE 
BANKRIGHT INTO THE BANK WHERE I KNEW THE WATER WAS DEEP 
 
WE TORE SLOWLY ALONG THE OVERHANGING BUSHES IN A WHIRL OF BROKEN TWIGS 
AND FLYING LEAVES THE FUSILLADE BELOW STOPPED SHORT AS I HAD FORESEEN 
IT WOULD WHEN THE SQUIRTS GOT EMPTY I THREW MY HEAD BACK TO A GLINTING 
WHIZZ THAT TRAVERSED THE PILOTHOUSE IN AT ONE SHUTTERHOLE AND OUT 
AT THE OTHER LOOKING PAST THAT MAD HELMSMAN WHO WAS SHAKING THE EMPTY 
RIFLE AND YELLING AT THE SHORE I SAW VAGUE FORMS OF MEN RUNNING BENT 
DOUBLE LEAPING GLIDING DISTINCT INCOMPLETE EVANESCENT SOMETHING 
BIG APPEARED IN THE AIR BEFORE THE SHUTTER THE RIFLE WENT OVERBOARD 
AND THE MAN STEPPED BACK SWIFTLY LOOKED AT ME OVER HIS SHOULDER IN AN 
EXTRAORDINARY PROFOUND FAMILIAR MANNER AND FELL UPON MY FEET THE 
SIDE OF HIS HEAD HIT THE WHEEL TWICE AND THE END OF WHAT APPEARED 
A LONG CANE CLATTERED ROUND AND KNOCKED OVER A LITTLE CAMPSTOOL IT 
LOOKED AS THOUGH AFTER WRENCHING THAT THING FROM SOMEBODY ASHORE HE HAD 
LOST HIS BALANCE IN THE EFFORT THE THIN SMOKE HAD BLOWN AWAY WE WERE 
CLEAR OF THE SNAG AND LOOKING AHEAD I COULD SEE THAT IN ANOTHER HUNDRED 
YARDS OR SO I WOULD BE FREE TO SHEER OFF AWAY FROM THE BANK BUT MY 
FEET FELT SO VERY WARM AND WET THAT I HAD TO LOOK DOWN THE MAN HAD 
ROLLED ON HIS BACK AND STARED STRAIGHT UP AT ME BOTH HIS HANDS CLUTCHED 
THAT CANE IT WAS THE SHAFT OF A SPEAR THAT EITHER THROWN OR LUNGED 
THROUGH THE OPENING HAD CAUGHT HIM IN THE SIDE JUST BELOW THE RIBS THE 
BLADE HAD GONE IN OUT OF SIGHT AFTER MAKING A FRIGHTFUL GASH MY SHOES 
WERE FULL A POOL OF BLOOD LAY VERY STILL GLEAMING DARKRED UNDER THE 
WHEEL HIS EYES SHONE WITH AN AMAZING LUSTER THE FUSILLADE BURST OUT 
AGAIN HE LOOKED AT ME ANXIOUSLY GRIPPING THE SPEAR LIKE SOMETHING 
PRECIOUS WITH AN AIR OF BEING AFRAID I WOULD TRY TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM 
HIM I HAD TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO FREE MY EYES FROM HIS GAZE AND ATTEND 
TO THE STEERING WITH ONE HAND I FELT ABOVE MY HEAD FOR THE LINE OF 
THE STEAMWHISTLE AND JERKED OUT SCREECH AFTER SCREECH HURRIEDLY THE 
TUMULT OF ANGRY AND WARLIKE YELLS WAS CHECKED INSTANTLY AND THEN FROM 
THE DEPTHS OF THE WOODS WENT OUT SUCH A TREMULOUS AND PROLONGED WAIL OF 
MOURNFUL FEAR AND UTTER DESPAIR AS MAY BE IMAGINED TO FOLLOW THE FLIGHT 
OF THE LAST HOPE FROM THE EARTH THERE WAS A GREAT COMMOTION IN THE 
BUSH THE SHOWER OF ARROWS STOPPED A FEW DROPPING SHOTS RANG OUT 
SHARPLYTHEN SILENCE IN WHICH THE LANGUID BEAT OF THE STERNWHEEL CAME 
PLAINLY TO MY EARS I PUT THE HELM HARD ASTARBOARD AT THE MOMENT WHEN 
THE PILGRIM IN PINK PYJAMAS VERY HOT AND AGITATED APPEARED IN THE 
DOORWAY THE MANAGER SENDS ME HE BEGAN IN AN OFFICIAL TONE AND 
STOPPED SHORT GOOD GOD HE SAID GLARING AT THE WOUNDED MAN 
 
WE TWO WHITES STOOD OVER HIM AND HIS LUSTROUS AND INQUIRING GLANCE 
ENVELOPED US BOTH I DECLARE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WOULD PRESENTLY PUT 
TO US SOME QUESTION IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE LANGUAGE BUT HE DIED WITHOUT 
UTTERING A SOUND WITHOUT MOVING A LIMB WITHOUT TWITCHING A MUSCLE 
ONLY IN THE VERY LAST MOMENT AS THOUGH IN RESPONSE TO SOME SIGN WE 
COULD NOT SEE TO SOME WHISPER WE COULD NOT HEAR HE FROWNED HEAVILY 
AND THAT FROWN GAVE TO HIS BLACK DEATHMASK AN INCONCEIVABLY SOMBER 
BROODING AND MENACING EXPRESSION THE LUSTER OF INQUIRING GLANCE FADED 
SWIFTLY INTO VACANT GLASSINESS CAN YOU STEER I ASKED THE AGENT 
EAGERLY HE LOOKED VERY DUBIOUS BUT I MADE A GRAB AT HIS ARM AND HE 
UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE I MEANT HIM TO STEER WHETHER OR NO TO TELL YOU 
THE TRUTH I WAS MORBIDLY ANXIOUS TO CHANGE MY SHOES AND SOCKS HE IS 
DEAD MURMURED THE FELLOW IMMENSELY IMPRESSED NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
SAID I TUGGING LIKE MAD AT THE SHOELACES AND BY THE WAY I SUPPOSE 
MR KURTZ IS DEAD AS WELL BY THIS TIME 
 
FOR THE MOMENT THAT WAS THE DOMINANT THOUGHT THERE WAS A SENSE OF 
EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT AS THOUGH I HAD FOUND OUT I HAD BEEN STRIVING 
AFTER SOMETHING ALTOGETHER WITHOUT A SUBSTANCE I COULDNT HAVE BEEN 
MORE DISGUSTED IF I HAD TRAVELED ALL THIS WAY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF 
TALKING WITH MR KURTZ TALKING WITH    I FLUNG ONE SHOE OVERBOARD 
AND BECAME AWARE THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD 
TOA TALK WITH KURTZ I MADE THE STRANGE DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NEVER 
IMAGINED HIM AS DOING YOU KNOW BUT AS DISCOURSING I DIDNT SAY TO 
MYSELF NOW I WILL NEVER SEE HIM OR NOW I WILL NEVER SHAKE HIM BY 
THE HAND BUT NOW I WILL NEVER HEAR HIM THE MAN PRESENTED HIMSELF 
AS A VOICE NOT OF COURSE THAT I DID NOT CONNECT HIM WITH SOME SORT OF 
ACTION HADNT I BEEN TOLD IN ALL THE TONES OF JEALOUSY AND ADMIRATION 
THAT HE HAD COLLECTED BARTERED SWINDLED OR STOLEN MORE IVORY THAN ALL 
THE OTHER AGENTS TOGETHER THAT WAS NOT THE POINT THE POINT WAS IN HIS 
BEING A GIFTED CREATURE AND THAT OF ALL HIS GIFTS THE ONE THAT STOOD 
OUT PREEMINENTLY THAT CARRIED WITH IT A SENSE OF REAL PRESENCE WAS 
HIS ABILITY TO TALK HIS WORDSTHE GIFT OF EXPRESSION THE BEWILDERING 
THE ILLUMINATING THE MOST EXALTED AND THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE THE 
PULSATING STREAM OF LIGHT OR THE DECEITFUL FLOW FROM THE HEART OF AN 
IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS 
 
THE OTHER SHOE WENT FLYING UNTO THE DEVILGOD OF THAT RIVER I THOUGHT 
BY JOVE ITS ALL OVER WE ARE TOO LATE HE HAS VANISHEDTHE GIFT HAS 
VANISHED BY MEANS OF SOME SPEAR ARROW OR CLUB I WILL NEVER HEAR THAT 
CHAP SPEAK AFTER ALLAND MY SORROW HAD A STARTLING EXTRAVAGANCE 
OF EMOTION EVEN SUCH AS I HAD NOTICED IN THE HOWLING SORROW OF THESE 
SAVAGES IN THE BUSH I COULDNT HAVE FELT MORE OF LONELY DESOLATION 
SOMEHOW HAD I BEEN ROBBED OF A BELIEF OR HAD MISSED MY DESTINY IN 
LIFE    WHY DO YOU SIGH IN THIS BEASTLY WAY SOMEBODY ABSURD WELL 
ABSURD GOOD LORD MUSTNT A MAN EVERHERE GIVE ME SOME TOBACCO    
 
THERE WAS A PAUSE OF PROFOUND STILLNESS THEN A MATCH FLARED AND 
MARLOWS LEAN FACE APPEARED WORN HOLLOW WITH DOWNWARD FOLDS AND 
DROPPED EYELIDS WITH AN ASPECT OF CONCENTRATED ATTENTION AND AS HE 
TOOK VIGOROUS DRAWS AT HIS PIPE IT SEEMED TO RETREAT AND ADVANCE OUT OF 
THE NIGHT IN THE REGULAR FLICKER OF THE TINY FLAME THE MATCH WENT OUT 
 
ABSURD HE CRIED THIS IS THE WORST OF TRYING TO TELL    HERE 
YOU ALL ARE EACH MOORED WITH TWO GOOD ADDRESSES LIKE A HULK WITH 
TWO ANCHORS A BUTCHER ROUND ONE CORNER A POLICEMAN ROUND ANOTHER 
EXCELLENT APPETITES AND TEMPERATURE NORMALYOU HEARNORMAL FROM 
YEARS END TO YEARS END AND YOU SAY ABSURD ABSURD BEEXPLODED 
ABSURD MY DEAR BOYS WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A MAN WHO OUT OF SHEER 
NERVOUSNESS HAD JUST FLUNG OVERBOARD A PAIR OF NEW SHOES NOW I THINK OF 
IT IT IS AMAZING I DID NOT SHED TEARS I AM UPON THE WHOLE PROUD 
OF MY FORTITUDE I WAS CUT TO THE QUICK AT THE IDEA OF HAVING LOST THE 
INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE OF LISTENING TO THE GIFTED KURTZ OF COURSE I 
WAS WRONG THE PRIVILEGE WAS WAITING FOR ME OH YES I HEARD MORE THAN 
ENOUGH AND I WAS RIGHT TOO A VOICE HE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE THAN A 
VOICE AND I HEARDHIMITTHIS VOICEOTHER VOICESALL OF THEM WERE 
SO LITTLE MORE THAN VOICESAND THE MEMORY OF THAT TIME ITSELF LINGERS 
AROUND ME IMPALPABLE LIKE A DYING VIBRATION OF ONE IMMENSE JABBER 
SILLY ATROCIOUS SORDID SAVAGE OR SIMPLY MEAN WITHOUT ANY KIND OF 
SENSE VOICES VOICESEVEN THE GIRL HERSELFNOW 
 
HE WAS SILENT FOR A LONG TIME 
 
I LAID THE GHOST OF HIS GIFTS AT LAST WITH A LIE HE BEGAN SUDDENLY 
GIRL WHAT DID I MENTION A GIRL OH SHE IS OUT OF ITCOMPLETELY 
THEYTHE WOMEN I MEANARE OUT OF ITSHOULD BE OUT OF IT WE MUST 
HELP THEM TO STAY IN THAT BEAUTIFUL WORLD OF THEIR OWN LEST OURS 
GETS WORSE OH SHE HAD TO BE OUT OF IT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE 
DISINTERRED BODY OF MR KURTZ SAYING MY INTENDED YOU WOULD HAVE 
PERCEIVED DIRECTLY THEN HOW COMPLETELY SHE WAS OUT OF IT AND THE LOFTY 
FRONTAL BONE OF MR KURTZ THEY SAY THE HAIR GOES ON GROWING SOMETIMES 
BUT THISAH SPECIMEN WAS IMPRESSIVELY BALD THE WILDERNESS HAD PATTED 
HIM ON THE HEAD AND BEHOLD IT WAS LIKE A BALLAN IVORY BALL IT HAD 
CARESSED HIM ANDLOHE HAD WITHERED IT HAD TAKEN HIM LOVED HIM 
EMBRACED HIM GOT INTO HIS VEINS CONSUMED HIS FLESH AND SEALED 
HIS SOUL TO ITS OWN BY THE INCONCEIVABLE CEREMONIES OF SOME DEVILISH 
INITIATION HE WAS ITS SPOILED AND PAMPERED FAVORITE IVORY I SHOULD 
THINK SO HEAPS OF IT STACKS OF IT THE OLD MUD SHANTY WAS BURSTING 
WITH IT YOU WOULD THINK THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE TUSK LEFT EITHER ABOVE 
OR BELOW THE GROUND IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY MOSTLY FOSSIL THE MANAGER 
HAD REMARKED DISPARAGINGLY IT WAS NO MORE FOSSIL THAN I AM BUT THEY 
CALL IT FOSSIL WHEN IT IS DUG UP IT APPEARS THESE NIGGERS DO BURY 
THE TUSKS SOMETIMESBUT EVIDENTLY THEY COULDNT BURY THIS PARCEL 
DEEP ENOUGH TO SAVE THE GIFTED MR KURTZ FROM HIS FATE WE FILLED THE 
STEAMBOAT WITH IT AND HAD TO PILE A LOT ON THE DECK THUS HE COULD 
SEE AND ENJOY AS LONG AS HE COULD SEE BECAUSE THE APPRECIATION OF THIS 
FAVOR HAD REMAINED WITH HIM TO THE LAST YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HIM SAY 
MY IVORY OH YES I HEARD HIM MY INTENDED MY IVORY MY STATION MY 
RIVER MY EVERYTHING BELONGED TO HIM IT MADE ME HOLD MY BREATH IN 
EXPECTATION OF HEARING THE WILDERNESS BURST INTO A PRODIGIOUS PEAL OF 
LAUGHTER THAT WOULD SHAKE THE FIXED STARS IN THEIR PLACES EVERYTHING 
BELONGED TO HIMBUT THAT WAS A TRIFLE THE THING WAS TO KNOW WHAT HE 
BELONGED TO HOW MANY POWERS OF DARKNESS CLAIMED HIM FOR THEIR OWN THAT 
WAS THE REFLECTION THAT MADE YOU CREEPY ALL OVER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLEIT 
WAS NOT GOOD FOR ONE EITHERTRYING TO IMAGINE HE HAD TAKEN A HIGH SEAT 
AMONGST THE DEVILS OF THE LANDI MEAN LITERALLY YOU CANT UNDERSTAND 
HOW COULD YOUWITH SOLID PAVEMENT UNDER YOUR FEET SURROUNDED BY KIND 
NEIGHBORS READY TO CHEER YOU OR TO FALL ON YOU STEPPING DELICATELY 
BETWEEN THE BUTCHER AND THE POLICEMAN IN THE HOLY TERROR OF SCANDAL AND 
GALLOWS AND LUNATIC ASYLUMSHOW CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT PARTICULAR REGION 
OF THE FIRST AGES A MANS UNTRAMMELED FEET MAY TAKE HIM INTO BY THE WAY 
OF SOLITUDEUTTER SOLITUDE WITHOUT A POLICEMANBY THE WAY OF SILENCE 
UTTER SILENCE WHERE NO WARNING VOICE OF A KIND NEIGHBOR CAN BE HEARD 
WHISPERING OF PUBLIC OPINION THESE LITTLE THINGS MAKE ALL THE GREAT 
DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY ARE GONE YOU MUST FALL BACK UPON YOUR OWN INNATE 
STRENGTH UPON YOUR OWN CAPACITY FOR FAITHFULNESS OF COURSE YOU MAY 
BE TOO MUCH OF A FOOL TO GO WRONGTOO DULL EVEN TO KNOW YOU ARE BEING 
ASSAULTED BY THE POWERS OF DARKNESS I TAKE IT NO FOOL EVER MADE A 
BARGAIN FOR HIS SOUL WITH THE DEVIL THE FOOL IS TOO MUCH OF A FOOL OR 
THE DEVIL TOO MUCH OF A DEVILI DONT KNOW WHICH OR YOU MAY BE SUCH 
A THUNDERINGLY EXALTED CREATURE AS TO BE ALTOGETHER DEAF AND BLIND TO 
ANYTHING BUT HEAVENLY SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THEN THE EARTH FOR YOU IS ONLY 
A STANDING PLACEAND WHETHER TO BE LIKE THIS IS YOUR LOSS OR YOUR GAIN 
I WONT PRETEND TO SAY BUT MOST OF US ARE NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER 
THE EARTH FOR US IS A PLACE TO LIVE IN WHERE WE MUST PUT UP WITH 
SIGHTS WITH SOUNDS WITH SMELLS TOO BY JOVEBREATHE DEAD HIPPO 
SO TO SPEAK AND NOT BE CONTAMINATED AND THERE DONT YOU SEE 
YOUR STRENGTH COMES IN THE FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY FOR THE DIGGING OF 
UNOSTENTATIOUS HOLES TO BURY THE STUFF INYOUR POWER OF DEVOTION 
NOT TO YOURSELF BUT TO AN OBSCURE BACKBREAKING BUSINESS AND THATS 
DIFFICULT ENOUGH MIND I AM NOT TRYING TO EXCUSE OR EVEN EXPLAINI AM 
TRYING TO ACCOUNT TO MYSELF FORFORMR KURTZFOR THE SHADE OF MR 
KURTZ THIS INITIATED WRAITH FROM THE BACK OF NOWHERE HONORED ME WITH 
ITS AMAZING CONFIDENCE BEFORE IT VANISHED ALTOGETHER THIS WAS BECAUSE 
IT COULD SPEAK ENGLISH TO ME THE ORIGINAL KURTZ HAD BEEN EDUCATED 
PARTLY IN ENGLAND ANDAS HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY HIMSELFHIS 
SYMPATHIES WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE HIS MOTHER WAS HALFENGLISH HIS 
FATHER WAS HALFFRENCH ALL EUROPE CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAKING OF KURTZ 
AND BYANDBY I LEARNED THAT MOST APPROPRIATELY THE INTERNATIONAL 
SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF SAVAGE CUSTOMS HAD INTRUSTED HIM WITH THE 
MAKING OF A REPORT FOR ITS FUTURE GUIDANCE AND HE HAD WRITTEN IT TOO 
IVE SEEN IT IVE READ IT IT WAS ELOQUENT VIBRATING WITH ELOQUENCE 
BUT TOO HIGHSTRUNG I THINK SEVENTEEN PAGES OF CLOSE WRITING HE HAD 
FOUND TIME FOR BUT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN BEFORE HISLET US SAYNERVES 
WENT WRONG AND CAUSED HIM TO PRESIDE AT CERTAIN MIDNIGHT DANCES ENDING 
WITH UNSPEAKABLE RITES WHICHAS FAR AS I RELUCTANTLY GATHERED 
FROM WHAT I HEARD AT VARIOUS TIMESWERE OFFERED UP TO HIMDO YOU 
UNDERSTANDTO MR KURTZ HIMSELF BUT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE 
OF WRITING THE OPENING PARAGRAPH HOWEVER IN THE LIGHT OF LATER 
INFORMATION STRIKES ME NOW AS OMINOUS HE BEGAN WITH THE ARGUMENT 
THAT WE WHITES FROM THE POINT OF DEVELOPMENT WE HAD ARRIVED AT MUST 
NECESSARILY APPEAR TO THEM SAVAGES IN THE NATURE OF SUPERNATURAL 
BEINGSWE APPROACH THEM WITH THE MIGHT AS OF A DEITY AND SO ON AND 
SO ON BY THE SIMPLE EXERCISE OF OUR WILL WE CAN EXERT A POWER FOR GOOD 
PRACTICALLY UNBOUNDED C C FROM THAT POINT HE SOARED AND TOOK ME 
WITH HIM THE PERORATION WAS MAGNIFICENT THOUGH DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER 
YOU KNOW IT GAVE ME THE NOTION OF AN EXOTIC IMMENSITY RULED BY AN 
AUGUST BENEVOLENCE IT MADE ME TINGLE WITH ENTHUSIASM THIS WAS THE 
UNBOUNDED POWER OF ELOQUENCEOF WORDSOF BURNING NOBLE WORDS THERE 
WERE NO PRACTICAL HINTS TO INTERRUPT THE MAGIC CURRENT OF PHRASES 
UNLESS A KIND OF NOTE AT THE FOOT OF THE LAST PAGE SCRAWLED EVIDENTLY 
MUCH LATER IN AN UNSTEADY HAND MAY BE REGARDED AS THE EXPOSITION OF 
A METHOD IT WAS VERY SIMPLE AND AT THE END OF THAT MOVING APPEAL TO 
EVERY ALTRUISTIC SENTIMENT IT BLAZED AT YOU LUMINOUS AND TERRIFYING 
LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN A SERENE SKY EXTERMINATE ALL THE BRUTES 
THE CURIOUS PART WAS THAT HE HAD APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT 
VALUABLE POSTSCRIPTUM BECAUSE LATER ON WHEN HE IN A SENSE CAME TO 
HIMSELF HE REPEATEDLY ENTREATED ME TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY PAMPHLET 
HE CALLED IT AS IT WAS SURE TO HAVE IN THE FUTURE A GOOD INFLUENCE 
UPON HIS CAREER I HAD FULL INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS AND 
BESIDES AS IT TURNED OUT I WAS TO HAVE THE CARE OF HIS MEMORY IVE 
DONE ENOUGH FOR IT TO GIVE ME THE INDISPUTABLE RIGHT TO LAY IT IF I 
CHOOSE FOR AN EVERLASTING REST IN THE DUSTBIN OF PROGRESS AMONGST 
ALL THE SWEEPINGS AND FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING ALL THE DEAD CATS OF 
CIVILIZATION BUT THEN YOU SEE I CANT CHOOSE HE WONT BE FORGOTTEN 
WHATEVER HE WAS HE WAS NOT COMMON HE HAD THE POWER TO CHARM OR 
FRIGHTEN RUDIMENTARY SOULS INTO AN AGGRAVATED WITCHDANCE IN HIS 
HONOR HE COULD ALSO FILL THE SMALL SOULS OF THE PILGRIMS WITH BITTER 
MISGIVINGS HE HAD ONE DEVOTED FRIEND AT LEAST AND HE HAD CONQUERED 
ONE SOUL IN THE WORLD THAT WAS NEITHER RUDIMENTARY NOR TAINTED WITH 
SELFSEEKING NO I CANT FORGET HIM THOUGH I AM NOT PREPARED TO AFFIRM 
THE FELLOW WAS EXACTLY WORTH THE LIFE WE LOST IN GETTING TO HIM I 
MISSED MY LATE HELMSMAN AWFULLYI MISSED HIM EVEN WHILE HIS BODY 
WAS STILL LYING IN THE PILOTHOUSE PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK IT PASSING 
STRANGE THIS REGRET FOR A SAVAGE WHO WAS NO MORE ACCOUNT THAN A GRAIN OF 
SAND IN A BLACK SAHARA WELL DONT YOU SEE HE HAD DONE SOMETHING HE 
HAD STEERED FOR MONTHS I HAD HIM AT MY BACKA HELPAN INSTRUMENT IT 
WAS A KIND OF PARTNERSHIP HE STEERED FOR MEI HAD TO LOOK AFTER HIM I 
WORRIED ABOUT HIS DEFICIENCIES AND THUS A SUBTLE BOND HAD BEEN CREATED 
OF WHICH I ONLY BECAME AWARE WHEN IT WAS SUDDENLY BROKEN AND THE 
INTIMATE PROFUNDITY OF THAT LOOK HE GAVE ME WHEN HE RECEIVED HIS HURT 
REMAINS TO THIS DAY IN MY MEMORYLIKE A CLAIM OF DISTANT KINSHIP 
AFFIRMED IN A SUPREME MOMENT 
 
POOR FOOL IF HE HAD ONLY LEFT THAT SHUTTER ALONE HE HAD NO RESTRAINT 
NO RESTRAINTJUST LIKE KURTZA TREE SWAYED BY THE WIND AS SOON AS 
I HAD PUT ON A DRY PAIR OF SLIPPERS I DRAGGED HIM OUT AFTER FIRST 
JERKING THE SPEAR OUT OF HIS SIDE WHICH OPERATION I CONFESS I PERFORMED 
WITH MY EYES SHUT TIGHT HIS HEELS LEAPED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE 
DOORSTEP HIS SHOULDERS WERE PRESSED TO MY BREAST I HUGGED HIM FROM 
BEHIND DESPERATELY OH HE WAS HEAVY HEAVY HEAVIER THAN ANY MAN ON 
EARTH I SHOULD IMAGINE THEN WITHOUT MORE ADO I TIPPED HIM OVERBOARD 
THE CURRENT SNATCHED HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A WISP OF GRASS AND I 
SAW THE BODY ROLL OVER TWICE BEFORE I LOST SIGHT OF IT FOR EVER ALL THE 
PILGRIMS AND THE MANAGER WERE THEN CONGREGATED ON THE AWNINGDECK 
ABOUT THE PILOTHOUSE CHATTERING AT EACH OTHER LIKE A FLOCK OF EXCITED 
MAGPIES AND THERE WAS A SCANDALIZED MURMUR AT MY HEARTLESS PROMPTITUDE 
WHAT THEY WANTED TO KEEP THAT BODY HANGING ABOUT FOR I CANT GUESS 
EMBALM IT MAYBE BUT I HAD ALSO HEARD ANOTHER AND A VERY OMINOUS 
MURMUR ON THE DECK BELOW MY FRIENDS THE WOODCUTTERS WERE LIKEWISE 
SCANDALIZED AND WITH A BETTER SHOW OF REASONTHOUGH I ADMIT THAT THE 
REASON ITSELF WAS QUITE INADMISSIBLE OH QUITE I HAD MADE UP MY MIND 
THAT IF MY LATE HELMSMAN WAS TO BE EATEN THE FISHES ALONE SHOULD HAVE 
HIM HE HAD BEEN A VERY SECONDRATE HELMSMAN WHILE ALIVE BUT NOW HE WAS 
DEAD HE MIGHT HAVE BECOME A FIRSTCLASS TEMPTATION AND POSSIBLY CAUSE 
SOME STARTLING TROUBLE BESIDES I WAS ANXIOUS TO TAKE THE WHEEL THE 
MAN IN PINK PYJAMAS SHOWING HIMSELF A HOPELESS DUFFER AT THE BUSINESS 
 
THIS I DID DIRECTLY THE SIMPLE FUNERAL WAS OVER WE WERE GOING 
HALFSPEED KEEPING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND I LISTENED 
TO THE TALK ABOUT ME THEY HAD GIVEN UP KURTZ THEY HAD GIVEN UP THE 
STATION KURTZ WAS DEAD AND THE STATION HAD BEEN BURNTAND SO ONAND 
SO ON THE REDHAIRED PILGRIM WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT 
AT LEAST THIS POOR KURTZ HAD BEEN PROPERLY REVENGED SAY WE MUST HAVE 
MADE A GLORIOUS SLAUGHTER OF THEM IN THE BUSH EH WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SAY HE POSITIVELY DANCED THE BLOODTHIRSTY LITTLE GINGERY BEGGAR 
AND HE HAD NEARLY FAINTED WHEN HE SAW THE WOUNDED MAN I COULD NOT HELP 
SAYING YOU MADE A GLORIOUS LOT OF SMOKE ANYHOW I HAD SEEN FROM THE 
WAY THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES RUSTLED AND FLEW THAT ALMOST ALL THE SHOTS 
HAD GONE TOO HIGH YOU CANT HIT ANYTHING UNLESS YOU TAKE AIM AND FIRE 
FROM THE SHOULDER BUT THESE CHAPS FIRED FROM THE HIP WITH THEIR EYES 
SHUT THE RETREAT I MAINTAINEDAND I WAS RIGHTWAS CAUSED BY THE 
SCREECHING OF THE STEAMWHISTLE UPON THIS THEY FORGOT KURTZ AND BEGAN 
TO HOWL AT ME WITH INDIGNANT PROTESTS 
 
THE MANAGER STOOD BY THE WHEEL MURMURING CONFIDENTIALLY ABOUT THE 
NECESSITY OF GETTING WELL AWAY DOWN THE RIVER BEFORE DARK AT ALL EVENTS 
WHEN I SAW IN THE DISTANCE A CLEARING ON THE RIVERSIDE AND THE OUTLINES 
OF SOME SORT OF BUILDING WHATS THIS I ASKED HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS 
IN WONDER THE STATION HE CRIED I EDGED IN AT ONCE STILL GOING 
HALFSPEED 
 
THROUGH MY GLASSES I SAW THE SLOPE OF A HILL INTERSPERSED WITH RARE 
TREES AND PERFECTLY FREE FROM UNDERGROWTH A LONG DECAYING BUILDING ON 
THE SUMMIT WAS HALF BURIED IN THE HIGH GRASS THE LARGE HOLES IN THE 
PEAKED ROOF GAPED BLACK FROM AFAR THE JUNGLE AND THE WOODS MADE A 
BACKGROUND THERE WAS NO INCLOSURE OR FENCE OF ANY KIND BUT THERE HAD 
BEEN ONE APPARENTLY FOR NEAR THE HOUSE HALFADOZEN SLIM POSTS REMAINED 
IN A ROW ROUGHLY TRIMMED AND WITH THEIR UPPER ENDS ORNAMENTED WITH 
ROUND CARVED BALLS THE RAILS OR WHATEVER THERE HAD BEEN BETWEEN HAD 
DISAPPEARED OF COURSE THE FOREST SURROUNDED ALL THAT THE RIVERBANK 
WAS CLEAR AND ON THE WATERSIDE I SAW A WHITE MAN UNDER A HAT LIKE A 
CARTWHEEL BECKONING PERSISTENTLY WITH HIS WHOLE ARM EXAMINING THE 
EDGE OF THE FOREST ABOVE AND BELOW I WAS ALMOST CERTAIN I COULD SEE 
MOVEMENTSHUMAN FORMS GLIDING HERE AND THERE I STEAMED PAST PRUDENTLY 
THEN STOPPED THE ENGINES AND LET HER DRIFT DOWN THE MAN ON THE SHORE 
BEGAN TO SHOUT URGING US TO LAND WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED SCREAMED 
THE MANAGER I KNOWI KNOW ITS ALL RIGHT YELLED BACK THE OTHER AS 
CHEERFUL AS YOU PLEASE COME ALONG ITS ALL RIGHT I AM GLAD 
 
HIS ASPECT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING I HAD SEENSOMETHING FUNNY I HAD 
SEEN SOMEWHERE AS I MANEUVERED TO GET ALONGSIDE I WAS ASKING MYSELF 
WHAT DOES THIS FELLOW LOOK LIKE SUDDENLY I GOT IT HE LOOKED LIKE 
A HARLEQUIN HIS CLOTHES HAD BEEN MADE OF SOME STUFF THAT WAS BROWN 
HOLLAND PROBABLY BUT IT WAS COVERED WITH PATCHES ALL OVER WITH BRIGHT 
PATCHES BLUE RED AND YELLOWPATCHES ON THE BACK PATCHES ON FRONT 
PATCHES ON ELBOWS ON KNEES COLORED BINDING ROUND HIS JACKET SCARLET 
EDGING AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS TROUSERS AND THE SUNSHINE MADE HIM LOOK 
EXTREMELY GAY AND WONDERFULLY NEAT WITHAL BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE HOW 
BEAUTIFULLY ALL THIS PATCHING HAD BEEN DONE A BEARDLESS BOYISH FACE 
VERY FAIR NO FEATURES TO SPEAK OF NOSE PEELING LITTLE BLUE EYES 
SMILES AND FROWNS CHASING EACH OTHER OVER THAT OPEN COUNTENANCE LIKE 
SUNSHINE AND SHADOW ON A WINDSWEPT PLAIN LOOK OUT CAPTAIN HE 
CRIED THERES A SNAG LODGED IN HERE LAST NIGHT WHAT ANOTHER SNAG I 
CONFESS I SWORE SHAMEFULLY I HAD NEARLY HOLED MY CRIPPLE TO FINISH OFF 
THAT CHARMING TRIP THE HARLEQUIN ON THE BANK TURNED HIS LITTLE PUG NOSE 
UP TO ME YOU ENGLISH HE ASKED ALL SMILES ARE YOU I SHOUTED FROM 
THE WHEEL THE SMILES VANISHED AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF SORRY FOR 
MY DISAPPOINTMENT THEN HE BRIGHTENED UP NEVER MIND HE CRIED 
ENCOURAGINGLY ARE WE IN TIME I ASKED HE IS UP THERE HE REPLIED 
WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD UP THE HILL AND BECOMING GLOOMY ALL OF A 
SUDDEN HIS FACE WAS LIKE THE AUTUMN SKY OVERCAST ONE MOMENT AND BRIGHT 
THE NEXT 
 
WHEN THE MANAGER ESCORTED BY THE PILGRIMS ALL OF THEM ARMED TO THE 
TEETH HAD GONE TO THE HOUSE THIS CHAP CAME ON BOARD I SAY I 
DONT LIKE THIS THESE NATIVES ARE IN THE BUSH I SAID HE ASSURED ME 
EARNESTLY IT WAS ALL RIGHT THEY ARE SIMPLE PEOPLE HE ADDED WELL 
I AM GLAD YOU CAME IT TOOK ME ALL MY TIME TO KEEP THEM OFF BUT YOU 
SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT I CRIED OH THEY MEANT NO HARM HE SAID AND 
AS I STARED HE CORRECTED HIMSELF NOT EXACTLY THEN VIVACIOUSLY MY 
FAITH YOUR PILOTHOUSE WANTS A CLEAN UP IN THE NEXT BREATH HE ADVISED 
ME TO KEEP ENOUGH STEAM ON THE BOILER TO BLOW THE WHISTLE IN CASE OF ANY 
TROUBLE ONE GOOD SCREECH WILL DO MORE FOR YOU THAN ALL YOUR RIFLES 
THEY ARE SIMPLE PEOPLE HE REPEATED HE RATTLED AWAY AT SUCH A RATE 
HE QUITE OVERWHELMED ME HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR LOTS OF 
SILENCE AND ACTUALLY HINTED LAUGHING THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE DONT 
YOU TALK WITH MR KURTZ I SAID YOU DONT TALK WITH THAT MANYOU 
LISTEN TO HIM HE EXCLAIMED WITH SEVERE EXALTATION BUT NOW HE 
WAVED HIS ARM AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE WAS IN THE UTTERMOST 
DEPTHS OF DESPONDENCY IN A MOMENT HE CAME UP AGAIN WITH A JUMP 
POSSESSED HIMSELF OF BOTH MY HANDS SHOOK THEM CONTINUOUSLY WHILE HE 
GABBLED BROTHER SAILOR    HONOR    PLEASURE    DELIGHT

TIME IN ENGLISH SHIPS WAS NOW RECONCILED WITH THE ARCHPRIEST HE MADE 
A POINT OF THAT BUT WHEN ONE IS YOUNG ONE MUST SEE THINGS GATHER 
EXPERIENCE IDEAS ENLARGE THE MIND HERE I INTERRUPTED YOU CAN 
NEVER TELL HERE I HAVE MET MR KURTZ HE SAID YOUTHFULLY SOLEMN AND 
REPROACHFUL I HELD MY TONGUE AFTER THAT IT APPEARS HE HAD PERSUADED A 
DUTCH TRADINGHOUSE ON THE COAST TO FIT HIM OUT WITH STORES AND GOODS 
AND HAD STARTED FOR THE INTERIOR WITH A LIGHT HEART AND NO MORE IDEA OF 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM THAN A BABY HE HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT THAT 
RIVER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS ALONE CUT OFF FROM EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING 
I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I LOOK I AM TWENTYFIVE HE SAID AT FIRST OLD 
VAN SHUYTEN WOULD TELL ME TO GO TO THE DEVIL HE NARRATED WITH KEEN 
ENJOYMENT BUT I STUCK TO HIM AND TALKED AND TALKED TILL AT LAST HE 
GOT AFRAID I WOULD TALK THE HINDLEG OFF HIS FAVORITE DOG SO HE GAVE 
ME SOME CHEAP THINGS AND A FEW GUNS AND TOLD ME HE HOPED HE WOULD NEVER 
SEE MY FACE AGAIN GOOD OLD DUTCHMAN VAN SHUYTEN IVE SENT HIM ONE 
SMALL LOT OF IVORY A YEAR AGO SO THAT HE CANT CALL ME A LITTLE THIEF 
WHEN I GET BACK I HOPE HE GOT IT AND FOR THE REST I DONT CARE I HAD 
SOME WOOD STACKED FOR YOU THAT WAS MY OLD HOUSE DID YOU SEE 
 
I GAVE HIM TOWSONS BOOK HE MADE AS THOUGH HE WOULD KISS ME BUT 
RESTRAINED HIMSELF THE ONLY BOOK I HAD LEFT AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST 
IT HE SAID LOOKING AT IT ECSTATICALLY SO MANY ACCIDENTS HAPPEN TO 
A MAN GOING ABOUT ALONE YOU KNOW CANOES GET UPSET SOMETIMESAND 
SOMETIMES YOUVE GOT TO CLEAR OUT SO QUICK WHEN THE PEOPLE GET ANGRY 
HE THUMBED THE PAGES YOU MADE NOTES IN RUSSIAN I ASKED HE NODDED

SERIOUS I HAD LOTS OF TROUBLE TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE OFF HE SAID DID

CURIOUSLY HE NODDED A NOD FULL OF MYSTERY AND WISDOM I TELL YOU HE 
CRIED THIS MAN HAS ENLARGED MY MIND HE OPENED HIS ARMS WIDE STARING 
AT ME WITH HIS LITTLE BLUE EYES THAT WERE PERFECTLY ROUND 
 
 
 
 
III 
 
 
I LOOKED AT HIM LOST IN ASTONISHMENT THERE HE WAS BEFORE ME IN 
MOTLEY AS THOUGH HE HAD ABSCONDED FROM A TROUPE OF MIMES ENTHUSIASTIC 
FABULOUS HIS VERY EXISTENCE WAS IMPROBABLE INEXPLICABLE AND 
ALTOGETHER BEWILDERING HE WAS AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM IT WAS 
INCONCEIVABLE HOW HE HAD EXISTED HOW HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING SO 
FAR HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO REMAINWHY HE DID NOT INSTANTLY DISAPPEAR 
I WENT A LITTLE FARTHER HE SAID THEN STILL A LITTLE FARTHERTILL 
I HAD GONE SO FAR THAT I DONT KNOW HOW ILL EVER GET BACK NEVER MIND 
PLENTY TIME I CAN MANAGE YOU TAKE KURTZ AWAY QUICKQUICKI TELL 
YOU THE GLAMOUR OF YOUTH ENVELOPED HIS PARTICOLORED RAGS HIS 
DESTITUTION HIS LONELINESS THE ESSENTIAL DESOLATION OF HIS FUTILE 
WANDERINGS FOR MONTHSFOR YEARSHIS LIFE HADNT BEEN WORTH A DAYS 
PURCHASE AND THERE HE WAS GALLANTLY THOUGHTLESSLY ALIVE TO ALL 
APPEARANCE INDESTRUCTIBLE SOLELY BY THE VIRTUE OF HIS FEW YEARS AND 
OF HIS UNREFLECTING AUDACITY I WAS SEDUCED INTO SOMETHING LIKE 
ADMIRATIONLIKE ENVY GLAMOUR URGED HIM ON GLAMOUR KEPT HIM UNSCATHED 
HE SURELY WANTED NOTHING FROM THE WILDERNESS BUT SPACE TO BREATHE IN AND 
TO PUSH ON THROUGH HIS NEED WAS TO EXIST AND TO MOVE ONWARDS AT 
THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RISK AND WITH A MAXIMUM OF PRIVATION IF THE 
ABSOLUTELY PURE UNCALCULATING UNPRACTICAL SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE HAD EVER 
RULED A HUMAN BEING IT RULED THIS BEPATCHED YOUTH I ALMOST ENVIED 
HIM THE POSSESSION OF THIS MODEST AND CLEAR FLAME IT SEEMED TO HAVE 
CONSUMED ALL THOUGHT OF SELF SO COMPLETELY THAT EVEN WHILE HE WAS 
TALKING TO YOU YOU FORGOT THAT IT WAS HETHE MAN BEFORE YOUR EYESWHO 
HAD GONE THROUGH THESE THINGS I DID NOT ENVY HIM HIS DEVOTION TO KURTZ 
THOUGH HE HAD NOT MEDITATED OVER IT IT CAME TO HIM AND HE ACCEPTED IT 
WITH A SORT OF EAGER FATALISM I MUST SAY THAT TO ME IT APPEARED ABOUT 
THE MOST DANGEROUS THING IN EVERY WAY HE HAD COME UPON SO FAR 
 
THEY HAD COME TOGETHER UNAVOIDABLY LIKE TWO SHIPS BECALMED NEAR 
EACH OTHER AND LAY RUBBING SIDES AT LAST I SUPPOSE KURTZ WANTED AN 
AUDIENCE BECAUSE ON A CERTAIN OCCASION WHEN ENCAMPED IN THE FOREST 
THEY HAD TALKED ALL NIGHT OR MORE PROBABLY KURTZ HAD TALKED WE TALKED 
OF EVERYTHING HE SAID QUITE TRANSPORTED AT THE RECOLLECTION I 
FORGOT THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS SLEEP THE NIGHT DID NOT SEEM TO LAST 
AN HOUR EVERYTHING EVERYTHING    OF LOVE TOO AH HE TALKED TO 
YOU OF LOVE I SAID MUCH AMUSED IT ISNT WHAT YOU THINK HE CRIED 
ALMOST PASSIONATELY IT WAS IN GENERAL HE MADE ME SEE THINGSTHINGS 
 
HE THREW HIS ARMS UP WE WERE ON DECK AT THE TIME AND THE HEADMAN 
OF MY WOODCUTTERS LOUNGING NEAR BY TURNED UPON HIM HIS HEAVY AND 
GLITTERING EYES I LOOKED AROUND AND I DONT KNOW WHY BUT I ASSURE YOU 
THAT NEVER NEVER BEFORE DID THIS LAND THIS RIVER THIS JUNGLE THE 
VERY ARCH OF THIS BLAZING SKY APPEAR TO ME SO HOPELESS AND SO DARK SO 
IMPENETRABLE TO HUMAN THOUGHT SO PITILESS TO HUMAN WEAKNESS AND EVER 
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN WITH HIM OF COURSE I SAID 
 
ON THE CONTRARY IT APPEARS THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH BROKEN 
BY VARIOUS CAUSES HE HAD AS HE INFORMED ME PROUDLY MANAGED TO NURSE 
KURTZ THROUGH TWO ILLNESSES HE ALLUDED TO IT AS YOU WOULD TO SOME RISKY 
FEAT BUT AS A RULE KURTZ WANDERED ALONE FAR IN THE DEPTHS OF THE 
FOREST VERY OFTEN COMING TO THIS STATION I HAD TO WAIT DAYS AND 
DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD TURN UP HE SAID AH IT WAS WORTH WAITING 
FORSOMETIMES WHAT WAS HE DOING EXPLORING OR WHAT I ASKED OH 
YES OF COURSE HE HAD DISCOVERED LOTS OF VILLAGES A LAKE TOOHE 
DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY IN WHAT DIRECTION IT WAS DANGEROUS TO INQUIRE 
TOO MUCHBUT MOSTLY HIS EXPEDITIONS HAD BEEN FOR IVORY BUT HE HAD NO 
GOODS TO TRADE WITH BY THAT TIME I OBJECTED THERES A GOOD LOT OF 
CARTRIDGES LEFT EVEN YET HE ANSWERED LOOKING AWAY TO SPEAK PLAINLY 
HE RAIDED THE COUNTRY I SAID HE NODDED NOT ALONE SURELY HE 
MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT THE VILLAGES ROUND THAT LAKE KURTZ GOT THE 
TRIBE TO FOLLOW HIM DID HE I SUGGESTED HE FIDGETED A LITTLE THEY 
ADORED HIM HE SAID THE TONE OF THESE WORDS WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT 
I LOOKED AT HIM SEARCHINGLY IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HIS MINGLED EAGERNESS 
AND RELUCTANCE TO SPEAK OF KURTZ THE MAN FILLED HIS LIFE OCCUPIED HIS 
THOUGHTS SWAYED HIS EMOTIONS WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT HE BURST OUT HE 
CAME TO THEM WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING YOU KNOWAND THEY HAD NEVER 
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE ITAND VERY TERRIBLE HE COULD BE VERY TERRIBLE 
YOU CANT JUDGE MR KURTZ AS YOU WOULD AN ORDINARY MAN NO NO NO 
NOWJUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEAI DONT MIND TELLING YOU HE WANTED TO 
SHOOT ME TOO ONE DAYBUT I DONT JUDGE HIM SHOOT YOU I CRIED 
WHAT FOR WELL I HAD A SMALL LOT OF IVORY THE CHIEF OF THAT VILLAGE 
NEAR MY HOUSE GAVE ME YOU SEE I USED TO SHOOT GAME FOR THEM WELL 
HE WANTED IT AND WOULDNT HEAR REASON HE DECLARED HE WOULD SHOOT ME 
UNLESS I GAVE HIM THE IVORY AND THEN CLEARED OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE 
HE COULD DO SO AND HAD A FANCY FOR IT AND THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH 
TO PREVENT HIM KILLING WHOM HE JOLLY WELL PLEASED AND IT WAS TRUE TOO 
I GAVE HIM THE IVORY WHAT DID I CARE BUT I DIDNT CLEAR OUT NO NO I 
COULDNT LEAVE HIM I HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF COURSE TILL WE GOT FRIENDLY 
AGAIN FOR A TIME HE HAD HIS SECOND ILLNESS THEN AFTERWARDS I HAD TO 
KEEP OUT OF THE WAY BUT I DIDNT MIND HE WAS LIVING FOR THE MOST PART 
IN THOSE VILLAGES ON THE LAKE WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO THE RIVER SOMETIMES 
HE WOULD TAKE TO ME AND SOMETIMES IT WAS BETTER FOR ME TO BE CAREFUL 
THIS MAN SUFFERED TOO MUCH HE HATED ALL THIS AND SOMEHOW HE COULDNT 
GET AWAY WHEN I HAD A CHANCE I BEGGED HIM TO TRY AND LEAVE WHILE THERE 
WAS TIME I OFFERED TO GO BACK WITH HIM AND HE WOULD SAY YES AND THEN 
HE WOULD REMAIN GO OFF ON ANOTHER IVORY HUNT DISAPPEAR FOR WEEKS 
FORGET HIMSELF AMONGST THESE PEOPLEFORGET HIMSELFYOU KNOW WHY 
HES MAD I SAID HE PROTESTED INDIGNANTLY MR KURTZ COULDNT BE MAD 
IF I HAD HEARD HIM TALK ONLY TWO DAYS AGO I WOULDNT DARE HINT AT 
SUCH A THING    I HAD TAKEN UP MY BINOCULARS WHILE WE TALKED AND WAS 
LOOKING AT THE SHORE SWEEPING THE LIMIT OF THE FOREST AT EACH SIDE AND 
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THERE BEING PEOPLE IN 
THAT BUSH SO SILENT SO QUIETAS SILENT AND QUIET AS THE RUINED HOUSE 
ON THE HILLMADE ME UNEASY THERE WAS NO SIGN ON THE FACE OF NATURE 
OF THIS AMAZING TALE THAT WAS NOT SO MUCH TOLD AS SUGGESTED TO ME IN 
DESOLATE EXCLAMATIONS COMPLETED BY SHRUGS IN INTERRUPTED PHRASES IN 
HINTS ENDING IN DEEP SIGHS THE WOODS WERE UNMOVED LIKE A MASKHEAVY 
LIKE THE CLOSED DOOR OF A PRISONTHEY LOOKED WITH THEIR AIR OF HIDDEN 
KNOWLEDGE OF PATIENT EXPECTATION OF UNAPPROACHABLE SILENCE THE 
RUSSIAN WAS EXPLAINING TO ME THAT IT WAS ONLY LATELY THAT MR KURTZ HAD 
COME DOWN TO THE RIVER BRINGING ALONG WITH HIM ALL THE FIGHTING MEN OF 
THAT LAKE TRIBE HE HAD BEEN ABSENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHSGETTING HIMSELF 
ADORED I SUPPOSEAND HAD COME DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY WITH THE INTENTION TO 
ALL APPEARANCE OF MAKING A RAID EITHER ACROSS THE RIVER OR DOWN STREAM 
EVIDENTLY THE APPETITE FOR MORE IVORY HAD GOT THE BETTER OF THEWHAT 
SHALL I SAYLESS MATERIAL ASPIRATIONS HOWEVER HE HAD GOT MUCH WORSE 
SUDDENLY I HEARD HE WAS LYING HELPLESS AND SO I CAME UPTOOK MY 
CHANCE SAID THE RUSSIAN OH HE IS BAD VERY BAD I DIRECTED MY 
GLASS TO THE HOUSE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF LIFE BUT THERE WAS THE 
RUINED ROOF THE LONG MUD WALL PEEPING ABOVE THE GRASS WITH THREE 
LITTLE SQUARE WINDOWHOLES NO TWO OF THE SAME SIZE ALL THIS BROUGHT 
WITHIN REACH OF MY HAND AS IT WERE AND THEN I MADE A BRUSQUE MOVEMENT 
AND ONE OF THE REMAINING POSTS OF THAT VANISHED FENCE LEAPED UP IN THE 
FIELD OF MY GLASS YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU I HAD BEEN STRUCK AT THE 
DISTANCE BY CERTAIN ATTEMPTS AT ORNAMENTATION RATHER REMARKABLE IN THE 
RUINOUS ASPECT OF THE PLACE NOW I HAD SUDDENLY A NEARER VIEW AND ITS 
FIRST RESULT WAS TO MAKE ME THROW MY HEAD BACK AS IF BEFORE A BLOW THEN 
I WENT CAREFULLY FROM POST TO POST WITH MY GLASS AND I SAW MY MISTAKE 
THESE ROUND KNOBS WERE NOT ORNAMENTAL BUT SYMBOLIC THEY WERE EXPRESSIVE 
AND PUZZLING STRIKING AND DISTURBINGFOOD FOR THOUGHT AND ALSO FOR 
THE VULTURES IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY LOOKING DOWN FROM THE SKY BUT AT ALL 
EVENTS FOR SUCH ANTS AS WERE INDUSTRIOUS ENOUGH TO ASCEND THE POLE 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE THOSE HEADS ON THE STAKES IF 
THEIR FACES HAD NOT BEEN TURNED TO THE HOUSE ONLY ONE THE FIRST I HAD 
MADE OUT WAS FACING MY WAY I WAS NOT SO SHOCKED AS YOU MAY THINK THE 
START BACK I HAD GIVEN WAS REALLY NOTHING BUT A MOVEMENT OF SURPRISE 
I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A KNOB OF WOOD THERE YOU KNOW I RETURNED 
DELIBERATELY TO THE FIRST I HAD SEENAND THERE IT WAS BLACK DRIED 
SUNKEN WITH CLOSED EYELIDSA HEAD THAT SEEMED TO SLEEP AT THE TOP OF 
THAT POLE AND WITH THE SHRUNKEN DRY LIPS SHOWING A NARROW WHITE LINE 
OF THE TEETH WAS SMILING TOO SMILING CONTINUOUSLY AT SOME ENDLESS AND 
JOCOSE DREAM OF THAT ETERNAL SLUMBER 
 
I AM NOT DISCLOSING ANY TRADE SECRETS IN FACT THE MANAGER SAID 
AFTERWARDS THAT MR KURTZS METHODS HAD RUINED THE DISTRICT I HAVE NO 
OPINION ON THAT POINT BUT I WANT YOU CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE 
WAS NOTHING EXACTLY PROFITABLE IN THESE HEADS BEING THERE THEY ONLY 
SHOWED THAT MR KURTZ LACKED RESTRAINT IN THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS 
VARIOUS LUSTS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WANTING IN HIMSOME SMALL 
MATTER WHICH WHEN THE PRESSING NEED AROSE COULD NOT BE FOUND UNDER 
HIS MAGNIFICENT ELOQUENCE WHETHER HE KNEW OF THIS DEFICIENCY HIMSELF I 
CANT SAY I THINK THE KNOWLEDGE CAME TO HIM AT LASTONLY AT THE VERY 
LAST BUT THE WILDERNESS HAD FOUND HIM OUT EARLY AND HAD TAKEN ON HIM A 
TERRIBLE VENGEANCE FOR THE FANTASTIC INVASION I THINK IT HAD WHISPERED 
TO HIM THINGS ABOUT HIMSELF WHICH HE DID NOT KNOW THINGS OF WHICH HE 
HAD NO CONCEPTION TILL HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THIS GREAT SOLITUDEAND THE 
WHISPER HAD PROVED IRRESISTIBLY FASCINATING IT ECHOED LOUDLY WITHIN HIM 
BECAUSE HE WAS HOLLOW AT THE CORE    I PUT DOWN THE GLASS AND THE 
HEAD THAT HAD APPEARED NEAR ENOUGH TO BE SPOKEN TO SEEMED AT ONCE TO 
HAVE LEAPED AWAY FROM ME INTO INACCESSIBLE DISTANCE 
 
THE ADMIRER OF MR KURTZ WAS A BIT CRESTFALLEN IN A HURRIED 
INDISTINCT VOICE HE BEGAN TO ASSURE ME HE HAD NOT DARED TO TAKE 
THESESAY SYMBOLSDOWN HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE NATIVES THEY WOULD 
NOT STIR TILL MR KURTZ GAVE THE WORD HIS ASCENDENCY WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
THE CAMPS OF THESE PEOPLE SURROUNDED THE PLACE AND THE CHIEFS CAME 
EVERY DAY TO SEE HIM THEY WOULD CRAWL    I DONT WANT TO KNOW 
ANYTHING OF THE CEREMONIES USED WHEN APPROACHING MR KURTZ I SHOUTED 
CURIOUS THIS FEELING THAT CAME OVER ME THAT SUCH DETAILS WOULD BE MORE 
INTOLERABLE THAN THOSE HEADS DRYING ON THE STAKES UNDER MR KURTZS 
WINDOWS AFTER ALL THAT WAS ONLY A SAVAGE SIGHT WHILE I SEEMED AT 
ONE BOUND TO HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO SOME LIGHTLESS REGION OF SUBTLE 
HORRORS WHERE PURE UNCOMPLICATED SAVAGERY WAS A POSITIVE RELIEF BEING 
SOMETHING THAT HAD A RIGHT TO EXISTOBVIOUSLYIN THE SUNSHINE THE 
YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT ME WITH SURPRISE I SUPPOSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM 
MR KURTZ WAS NO IDOL OF MINE HE FORGOT I HADNT HEARD ANY OF THESE 
SPLENDID MONOLOGUES ON WHAT WAS IT ON LOVE JUSTICE CONDUCT OF 
LIFEOR WHAT NOT IF IT HAD COME TO CRAWLING BEFORE MR KURTZ HE 
CRAWLED AS MUCH AS THE VERIEST SAVAGE OF THEM ALL I HAD NO IDEA OF THE 
CONDITIONS HE SAID THESE HEADS WERE THE HEADS OF REBELS I SHOCKED HIM 
EXCESSIVELY BY LAUGHING REBELS WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT DEFINITION I 
WAS TO HEAR THERE HAD BEEN ENEMIES CRIMINALS WORKERSAND THESE 
WERE REBELS THOSE REBELLIOUS HEADS LOOKED VERY SUBDUED TO ME ON THEIR 
STICKS YOU DONT KNOW HOW SUCH A LIFE TRIES A MAN LIKE KURTZ CRIED 
KURTZS LAST DISCIPLE WELL AND YOU I SAID I I I AM A SIMPLE 
MAN I HAVE NO GREAT THOUGHTS I WANT NOTHING FROM ANYBODY HOW CAN 
YOU COMPARE ME TO    HIS FEELINGS WERE TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH AND 
SUDDENLY HE BROKE DOWN I DONT UNDERSTAND HE GROANED IVE BEEN 
DOING MY BEST TO KEEP HIM ALIVE AND THATS ENOUGH I HAD NO HAND IN 
ALL THIS I HAVE NO ABILITIES THERE HASNT BEEN A DROP OF MEDICINE OR A 
MOUTHFUL OF INVALID FOOD FOR MONTHS HERE HE WAS SHAMEFULLY ABANDONED 
A MAN LIKE THIS WITH SUCH IDEAS SHAMEFULLY SHAMEFULLY IIHAVENT 
SLEPT FOR THE LAST TEN NIGHTS    
 
HIS VOICE LOST ITSELF IN THE CALM OF THE EVENING THE LONG SHADOWS OF 
THE FOREST HAD SLIPPED DOWN HILL WHILE WE TALKED HAD GONE FAR BEYOND 
THE RUINED HOVEL BEYOND THE SYMBOLIC ROW OF STAKES ALL THIS WAS IN THE 
GLOOM WHILE WE DOWN THERE WERE YET IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE STRETCH 
OF THE RIVER ABREAST OF THE CLEARING GLITTERED IN A STILL AND DAZZLING 
SPLENDOR WITH A MURKY AND OVERSHADOWED BEND ABOVE AND BELOW NOT A 
LIVING SOUL WAS SEEN ON THE SHORE THE BUSHES DID NOT RUSTLE 
 
SUDDENLY ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE A GROUP OF MEN APPEARED AS 
THOUGH THEY HAD COME UP FROM THE GROUND THEY WADED WAISTDEEP IN THE 
GRASS IN A COMPACT BODY BEARING AN IMPROVISED STRETCHER IN THEIR 
MIDST INSTANTLY IN THE EMPTINESS OF THE LANDSCAPE A CRY AROSE WHOSE 
SHRILLNESS PIERCED THE STILL AIR LIKE A SHARP ARROW FLYING STRAIGHT TO 
THE VERY HEART OF THE LAND AND AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT STREAMS OF HUMAN 
BEINGSOF NAKED HUMAN BEINGSWITH SPEARS IN THEIR HANDS WITH BOWS 
WITH SHIELDS WITH WILD GLANCES AND SAVAGE MOVEMENTS WERE POURED INTO 
THE CLEARING BY THE DARKFACED AND PENSIVE FOREST THE BUSHES SHOOK THE 
GRASS SWAYED FOR A TIME AND THEN EVERYTHING STOOD STILL IN ATTENTIVE 
IMMOBILITY 
 
NOW IF HE DOES NOT SAY THE RIGHT THING TO THEM WE ARE ALL DONE FOR 
SAID THE RUSSIAN AT MY ELBOW THE KNOT OF MEN WITH THE STRETCHER HAD 
STOPPED TOO HALFWAY TO THE STEAMER AS IF PETRIFIED I SAW THE MAN ON 
THE STRETCHER SIT UP LANK AND WITH AN UPLIFTED ARM ABOVE THE SHOULDERS 
OF THE BEARERS LET US HOPE THAT THE MAN WHO CAN TALK SO WELL OF LOVE 
IN GENERAL WILL FIND SOME PARTICULAR REASON TO SPARE US THIS TIME I 
SAID I RESENTED BITTERLY THE ABSURD DANGER OF OUR SITUATION AS IF 
TO BE AT THE MERCY OF THAT ATROCIOUS PHANTOM HAD BEEN A DISHONORING 
NECESSITY I COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND BUT THROUGH MY GLASSES I SAW THE 
THIN ARM EXTENDED COMMANDINGLY THE LOWER JAW MOVING THE EYES OF 
THAT APPARITION SHINING DARKLY FAR IN ITS BONY HEAD THAT NODDED WITH 
GROTESQUE JERKS KURTZKURTZTHAT MEANS SHORT IN GERMANDONT IT 
WELL THE NAME WAS AS TRUE AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS LIFEAND DEATH 
HE LOOKED AT LEAST SEVEN FEET LONG HIS COVERING HAD FALLEN OFF AND HIS 
BODY EMERGED FROM IT PITIFUL AND APPALLING AS FROM A WINDINGSHEET I 
COULD SEE THE CAGE OF HIS RIBS ALL ASTIR THE BONES OF HIS ARM WAVING 
IT WAS AS THOUGH AN ANIMATED IMAGE OF DEATH CARVED OUT OF OLD IVORY HAD 
BEEN SHAKING ITS HAND WITH MENACES AT A MOTIONLESS CROWD OF MEN MADE OF 
DARK AND GLITTERING BRONZE I SAW HIM OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDEIT GAVE HIM 
A WEIRDLY VORACIOUS ASPECT AS THOUGH HE HAD WANTED TO SWALLOW ALL THE 
AIR ALL THE EARTH ALL THE MEN BEFORE HIM A DEEP VOICE REACHED 
ME FAINTLY HE MUST HAVE BEEN SHOUTING HE FELL BACK SUDDENLY THE 
STRETCHER SHOOK AS THE BEARERS STAGGERED FORWARD AGAIN AND ALMOST AT 
THE SAME TIME I NOTICED THAT THE CROWD OF SAVAGES WAS VANISHING WITHOUT 
ANY PERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT OF RETREAT AS IF THE FOREST THAT HAD EJECTED 
THESE BEINGS SO SUDDENLY HAD DRAWN THEM IN AGAIN AS THE BREATH IS DRAWN 
IN A LONG ASPIRATION 
 
SOME OF THE PILGRIMS BEHIND THE STRETCHER CARRIED HIS ARMSTWO 
SHOTGUNS A HEAVY RIFLE AND A LIGHT REVOLVERCARBINETHE THUNDERBOLTS 
OF THAT PITIFUL JUPITER THE MANAGER BENT OVER HIM MURMURING AS 
HE WALKED BESIDE HIS HEAD THEY LAID HIM DOWN IN ONE OF THE LITTLE 
CABINSJUST A ROOM FOR A BEDPLACE AND A CAMPSTOOL OR TWO YOU KNOW 
WE HAD BROUGHT HIS BELATED CORRESPONDENCE AND A LOT OF TORN ENVELOPES 
AND OPEN LETTERS LITTERED HIS BED HIS HAND ROAMED FEEBLY AMONGST THESE 
PAPERS I WAS STRUCK BY THE FIRE OF HIS EYES AND THE COMPOSED LANGUOR OF 
HIS EXPRESSION IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE EXHAUSTION OF DISEASE HE DID NOT 
SEEM IN PAIN THIS SHADOW LOOKED SATIATED AND CALM AS THOUGH FOR THE 
MOMENT IT HAD HAD ITS FILL OF ALL THE EMOTIONS 
 
HE RUSTLED ONE OF THE LETTERS AND LOOKING STRAIGHT IN MY FACE SAID 
I AM GLAD SOMEBODY HAD BEEN WRITING TO HIM ABOUT ME THESE SPECIAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TURNING UP AGAIN THE VOLUME OF TONE HE EMITTED 
WITHOUT EFFORT ALMOST WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF MOVING HIS LIPS AMAZED 
ME A VOICE A VOICE IT WAS GRAVE PROFOUND VIBRATING WHILE THE MAN 
DID NOT SEEM CAPABLE OF A WHISPER HOWEVER HE HAD ENOUGH STRENGTH IN 
HIMFACTITIOUS NO DOUBTTO VERY NEARLY MAKE AN END OF US AS YOU SHALL 
HEAR DIRECTLY 
 
THE MANAGER APPEARED SILENTLY IN THE DOORWAY I STEPPED OUT AT ONCE 
AND HE DREW THE CURTAIN AFTER ME THE RUSSIAN EYED CURIOUSLY BY THE 
PILGRIMS WAS STARING AT THE SHORE I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF HIS 
GLANCE 
 
DARK HUMAN SHAPES COULD BE MADE OUT IN THE DISTANCE FLITTING 
INDISTINCTLY AGAINST THE GLOOMY BORDER OF THE FOREST AND NEAR THE RIVER 
TWO BRONZE FIGURES LEANING ON TALL SPEARS STOOD IN THE SUNLIGHT UNDER 
FANTASTIC HEADDRESSES OF SPOTTED SKINS WARLIKE AND STILL IN STATUESQUE 
REPOSE AND FROM RIGHT TO LEFT ALONG THE LIGHTED SHORE MOVED A WILD AND 
GORGEOUS APPARITION OF A WOMAN 
 
SHE WALKED WITH MEASURED STEPS DRAPED IN STRIPED AND FRINGED CLOTHS 
TREADING THE EARTH PROUDLY WITH A SLIGHT JINGLE AND FLASH OF BARBAROUS 
ORNAMENTS SHE CARRIED HER HEAD HIGH HER HAIR WAS DONE IN THE SHAPE OF 
A HELMET SHE HAD BRASS LEGGINGS TO THE KNEE BRASS WIRE GAUNTLETS TO 
THE ELBOW A CRIMSON SPOT ON HER TAWNY CHEEK INNUMERABLE NECKLACES OF 
GLASS BEADS ON HER NECK BIZARRE THINGS CHARMS GIFTS OF WITCHMEN 
THAT HUNG ABOUT HER GLITTERED AND TREMBLED AT EVERY STEP SHE MUST HAVE 
HAD THE VALUE OF SEVERAL ELEPHANT TUSKS UPON HER SHE WAS SAVAGE AND 
SUPERB WILDEYED AND MAGNIFICENT THERE WAS SOMETHING OMINOUS AND 
STATELY IN HER DELIBERATE PROGRESS AND IN THE HUSH THAT HAD FALLEN 
SUDDENLY UPON THE WHOLE SORROWFUL LAND THE IMMENSE WILDERNESS THE 
COLOSSAL BODY OF THE FECUND AND MYSTERIOUS LIFE SEEMED TO LOOK AT HER 
PENSIVE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THE IMAGE OF ITS OWN TENEBROUS 
AND PASSIONATE SOUL 
 
SHE CAME ABREAST OF THE STEAMER STOOD STILL AND FACED US HER LONG 
SHADOW FELL TO THE WATERS EDGE HER FACE HAD A TRAGIC AND FIERCE 
ASPECT OF WILD SORROW AND OF DUMB PAIN MINGLED WITH THE FEAR OF SOME 
STRUGGLING HALFSHAPED RESOLVE SHE STOOD LOOKING AT US WITHOUT A 
STIR AND LIKE THE WILDERNESS ITSELF WITH AN AIR OF BROODING OVER AN 
INSCRUTABLE PURPOSE A WHOLE MINUTE PASSED AND THEN SHE MADE A STEP 
FORWARD THERE WAS A LOW JINGLE A GLINT OF YELLOW METAL A SWAY OF 
FRINGED DRAPERIES AND SHE STOPPED AS IF HER HEART HAD FAILED HER THE 
YOUNG FELLOW BY MY SIDE GROWLED THE PILGRIMS MURMURED AT MY BACK 
SHE LOOKED AT US ALL AS IF HER LIFE HAD DEPENDED UPON THE UNSWERVING 
STEADINESS OF HER GLANCE SUDDENLY SHE OPENED HER BARED ARMS AND THREW 
THEM UP RIGID ABOVE HER HEAD AS THOUGH IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE DESIRE TO 
TOUCH THE SKY AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SWIFT SHADOWS DARTED OUT ON THE 
EARTH SWEPT AROUND ON THE RIVER GATHERING THE STEAMER INTO A SHADOWY 
EMBRACE A FORMIDABLE SILENCE HUNG OVER THE SCENE 
 
SHE TURNED AWAY SLOWLY WALKED ON FOLLOWING THE BANK AND PASSED INTO 
THE BUSHES TO THE LEFT ONCE ONLY HER EYES GLEAMED BACK AT US IN THE 
DUSK OF THE THICKETS BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED 
 
IF SHE HAD OFFERED TO COME ABOARD I REALLY THINK I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO 
SHOOT HER SAID THE MAN OF PATCHES NERVOUSLY I HAD BEEN RISKING MY 
LIFE EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE HOUSE SHE 
GOT IN ONE DAY AND KICKED UP A ROW ABOUT THOSE MISERABLE RAGS I PICKED 
UP IN THE STOREROOM TO MEND MY CLOTHES WITH I WASNT DECENT AT LEAST 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT FOR SHE TALKED LIKE A FURY TO KURTZ FOR AN HOUR 
POINTING AT ME NOW AND THEN I DONT UNDERSTAND THE DIALECT OF THIS 
TRIBE LUCKILY FOR ME I FANCY KURTZ FELT TOO ILL THAT DAY TO CARE OR 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MISCHIEF I DONT UNDERSTAND    NOITS TOO 
MUCH FOR ME AH WELL ITS ALL OVER NOW 
 
AT THIS MOMENT I HEARD KURTZS DEEP VOICE BEHIND THE CURTAIN SAVE

LEAD ME ASIDE HE IS VERY LOW VERY LOW HE SAID HE CONSIDERED IT 
NECESSARY TO SIGH BUT NEGLECTED TO BE CONSISTENTLY SORROWFUL WE HAVE 
DONE ALL WE COULD FOR HIMHAVENT WE BUT THERE IS NO DISGUISING THE 
FACT MR KURTZ HAS DONE MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO THE COMPANY HE DID

FOSSIL WE MUST SAVE IT AT ALL EVENTSBUT LOOK HOW PRECARIOUS THE 
POSITION ISAND WHY BECAUSE THE METHOD IS UNSOUND DO YOU SAID I

QUARTER OH SAID I THAT FELLOWWHATS HIS NAMETHE BRICKMAKER

NEVERTHELESS I THINK MR KURTZ IS A REMARKABLE MAN I SAID WITH 
EMPHASIS HE STARTED DROPPED ON ME A COLD HEAVY GLANCE SAID VERY 
QUIETLY HE WAS AND TURNED HIS BACK ON ME MY HOUR OF FAVOR WAS 
OVER I FOUND MYSELF LUMPED ALONG WITH KURTZ AS A PARTISAN OF METHODS 
FOR WHICH THE TIME WAS NOT RIPE I WAS UNSOUND AH BUT IT WAS SOMETHING 
TO HAVE AT LEAST A CHOICE OF NIGHTMARES 
 
I HAD TURNED TO THE WILDERNESS REALLY NOT TO MR KURTZ WHO I WAS 
READY TO ADMIT WAS AS GOOD AS BURIED AND FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED TO ME 
AS IF I ALSO WERE BURIED IN A VAST GRAVE FULL OF UNSPEAKABLE SECRETS I 
FELT AN INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OPPRESSING MY BREAST THE SMELL OF THE DAMP 
EARTH THE UNSEEN PRESENCE OF VICTORIOUS CORRUPTION THE DARKNESS OF AN 
IMPENETRABLE NIGHT    THE RUSSIAN TAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER I HEARD 
HIM MUMBLING AND STAMMERING SOMETHING ABOUT BROTHER SEAMANCOULDNT 
CONCEALKNOWLEDGE OF MATTERS THAT WOULD AFFECT MR KURTZS REPUTATION 
I WAITED FOR HIM EVIDENTLY MR KURTZ WAS NOT IN HIS GRAVE I SUSPECT

SPEAK OUT AS IT HAPPENS I AM MR KURTZS FRIENDIN A WAY 
 
HE STATED WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORMALITY THAT HAD WE NOT BEEN OF THE 
SAME PROFESSION HE WOULD HAVE KEPT THE MATTER TO HIMSELF WITHOUT 
REGARD TO CONSEQUENCES HE SUSPECTED THERE WAS AN ACTIVE ILLWILL 
TOWARDS HIM ON THE PART OF THESE WHITE MEN THAT YOU ARE RIGHT I 
SAID REMEMBERING A CERTAIN CONVERSATION I HAD OVERHEARD THE MANAGER 
THINKS YOU OUGHT TO BE HANGED HE SHOWED A CONCERN AT THIS INTELLIGENCE 
WHICH AMUSED ME AT FIRST I HAD BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY QUIETLY HE 
SAID EARNESTLY I CAN DO NO MORE FOR KURTZ NOW AND THEY WOULD SOON 
FIND SOME EXCUSE WHATS TO STOP THEM THERES A MILITARY POST THREE 
HUNDRED MILES FROM HERE WELL UPON MY WORD SAID I PERHAPS YOU 
HAD BETTER GO IF YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS AMONGST THE SAVAGES NEAR BY 
PLENTY HE SAID THEY ARE SIMPLE PEOPLEAND I WANT NOTHING YOU 
KNOW HE STOOD BITING HIS LIPS THEN I DONT WANT ANY HARM TO HAPPEN 
TO THESE WHITES HERE BUT OF COURSE I WAS THINKING OF MR KURTZS 
REPUTATIONBUT YOU ARE A BROTHER SEAMAN AND ALL RIGHT SAID I 
AFTER A TIME MR KURTZS REPUTATION IS SAFE WITH ME I DID NOT KNOW 
HOW TRULY I SPOKE 
 
HE INFORMED ME LOWERING HIS VOICE THAT IT WAS KURTZ WHO HAD ORDERED 
THE ATTACK TO BE MADE ON THE STEAMER HE HATED SOMETIMES THE IDEA OF 
BEING TAKEN AWAYAND THEN AGAIN    BUT I DONT UNDERSTAND THESE 
MATTERS I AM A SIMPLE MAN HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SCARE YOU AWAYTHAT YOU 
WOULD GIVE IT UP THINKING HIM DEAD I COULD NOT STOP HIM OH I HAD AN 
AWFUL TIME OF IT THIS LAST MONTH VERY WELL I SAID HE IS ALL RIGHT 
NOW YEEES HE MUTTERED NOT VERY CONVINCED APPARENTLY THANKS 
SAID I I SHALL KEEP MY EYES OPEN BUT QUIETEH HE URGED 
ANXIOUSLY IT WOULD BE AWFUL FOR HIS REPUTATION IF ANYBODY HERE I 
PROMISED A COMPLETE DISCRETION WITH GREAT GRAVITY I HAVE A CANOE AND 
THREE BLACK FELLOWS WAITING NOT VERY FAR I AM OFF COULD YOU GIVE ME A 
FEW MARTINIHENRY CARTRIDGES I COULD AND DID WITH PROPER SECRECY HE 
HELPED HIMSELF WITH A WINK AT ME TO A HANDFUL OF MY TOBACCO BETWEEN 
SAILORSYOU KNOWGOOD ENGLISH TOBACCO AT THE DOOR OF THE PILOTHOUSE 
HE TURNED ROUND I SAY HAVENT YOU A PAIR OF SHOES YOU COULD SPARE 
HE RAISED ONE LEG LOOK THE SOLES WERE TIED WITH KNOTTED STRINGS 
SANDALWISE UNDER HIS BARE FEET I ROOTED OUT AN OLD PAIR AT WHICH HE 
LOOKED WITH ADMIRATION BEFORE TUCKING IT UNDER HIS LEFT ARM ONE OF HIS 
POCKETS BRIGHT RED WAS BULGING WITH CARTRIDGES FROM THE OTHER DARK 
BLUE PEEPED TOWSONS INQUIRY C C HE SEEMED TO THINK HIMSELF 
EXCELLENTLY WELL EQUIPPED FOR A RENEWED ENCOUNTER WITH THE WILDERNESS 
AH ILL NEVER NEVER MEET SUCH A MAN AGAIN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE HEARD 
HIM RECITE POETRYHIS OWN TOO IT WAS HE TOLD ME POETRY HE ROLLED 
HIS EYES AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THESE DELIGHTS OH HE ENLARGED MY 
MIND GOODBY SAID I HE SHOOK HANDS AND VANISHED IN THE NIGHT 
SOMETIMES I ASK MYSELF WHETHER I HAD EVER REALLY SEEN HIMWHETHER IT 
WAS POSSIBLE TO MEET SUCH A PHENOMENON    
 
WHEN I WOKE UP SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT HIS WARNING CAME TO MY MIND WITH 
ITS HINT OF DANGER THAT SEEMED IN THE STARRED DARKNESS REAL ENOUGH TO 
MAKE ME GET UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A LOOK ROUND ON THE HILL A 
BIG FIRE BURNED ILLUMINATING FITFULLY A CROOKED CORNER OF THE 
STATIONHOUSE ONE OF THE AGENTS WITH A PICKET OF A FEW OF OUR BLACKS 
ARMED FOR THE PURPOSE WAS KEEPING GUARD OVER THE IVORY BUT DEEP WITHIN 
THE FOREST RED GLEAMS THAT WAVERED THAT SEEMED TO SINK AND RISE FROM 
THE GROUND AMONGST CONFUSED COLUMNAR SHAPES OF INTENSE BLACKNESS SHOWED 
THE EXACT POSITION OF THE CAMP WHERE MR KURTZS ADORERS WERE KEEPING 
THEIR UNEASY VIGIL THE MONOTONOUS BEATING OF A BIG DRUM FILLED THE AIR 
WITH MUFFLED SHOCKS AND A LINGERING VIBRATION A STEADY DRONING SOUND OF 
MANY MEN CHANTING EACH TO HIMSELF SOME WEIRD INCANTATION CAME OUT FROM 
THE BLACK FLAT WALL OF THE WOODS AS THE HUMMING OF BEES COMES OUT OF 
A HIVE AND HAD A STRANGE NARCOTIC EFFECT UPON MY HALFAWAKE SENSES 
I BELIEVE I DOZED OFF LEANING OVER THE RAIL TILL AN ABRUPT BURST OF 
YELLS AN OVERWHELMING OUTBREAK OF A PENTUP AND MYSTERIOUS FRENZY WOKE 
ME UP IN A BEWILDERED WONDER IT WAS CUT SHORT ALL AT ONCE AND THE 
LOW DRONING WENT ON WITH AN EFFECT OF AUDIBLE AND SOOTHING SILENCE I 
GLANCED CASUALLY INTO THE LITTLE CABIN A LIGHT WAS BURNING WITHIN BUT 
MR KURTZ WAS NOT THERE 
 
I THINK I WOULD HAVE RAISED AN OUTCRY IF I HAD BELIEVED MY EYES BUT I 
DIDNT BELIEVE THEM AT FIRSTTHE THING SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE THE FACT 
IS I WAS COMPLETELY UNNERVED BY A SHEER BLANK FRIGHT PURE ABSTRACT 
TERROR UNCONNECTED WITH ANY DISTINCT SHAPE OF PHYSICAL DANGER WHAT 
MADE THIS EMOTION SO OVERPOWERING WASHOW SHALL I DEFINE ITTHE MORAL 
SHOCK I RECEIVED AS IF SOMETHING ALTOGETHER MONSTROUS INTOLERABLE TO 
THOUGHT AND ODIOUS TO THE SOUL HAD BEEN THRUST UPON ME UNEXPECTEDLY 
THIS LASTED OF COURSE THE MEREST FRACTION OF A SECOND AND THEN THE 
USUAL SENSE OF COMMONPLACE DEADLY DANGER THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUDDEN 
ONSLAUGHT AND MASSACRE OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND WHICH I SAW IMPENDING 
WAS POSITIVELY WELCOME AND COMPOSING IT PACIFIED ME IN FACT SO MUCH 
THAT I DID NOT RAISE AN ALARM 
 
THERE WAS AN AGENT BUTTONED UP INSIDE AN ULSTER AND SLEEPING ON A CHAIR 
ON DECK WITHIN THREE FEET OF ME THE YELLS HAD NOT AWAKENED HIM HE 
SNORED VERY SLIGHTLY I LEFT HIM TO HIS SLUMBERS AND LEAPED ASHORE I 
DID NOT BETRAY MR KURTZIT WAS ORDERED I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIMIT 
WAS WRITTEN I SHOULD BE LOYAL TO THE NIGHTMARE OF MY CHOICE I WAS 
ANXIOUS TO DEAL WITH THIS SHADOW BY MYSELF ALONEAND TO THIS DAY I 
DONT KNOW WHY I WAS SO JEALOUS OF SHARING WITH ANYONE THE PECULIAR 
BLACKNESS OF THAT EXPERIENCE 
 
AS SOON AS I GOT ON THE BANK I SAW A TRAILA BROAD TRAIL THROUGH THE 
GRASS I REMEMBER THE EXULTATION WITH WHICH I SAID TO MYSELF HE CANT 
WALKHE IS CRAWLING ON ALLFOURSIVE GOT HIM THE GRASS WAS WET 
WITH DEW I STRODE RAPIDLY WITH CLENCHED FISTS I FANCY I HAD SOME VAGUE 
NOTION OF FALLING UPON HIM AND GIVING HIM A DRUBBING I DONT KNOW I 
HAD SOME IMBECILE THOUGHTS THE KNITTING OLD WOMAN WITH THE CAT OBTRUDED 
HERSELF UPON MY MEMORY AS A MOST IMPROPER PERSON TO BE SITTING AT THE 
OTHER END OF SUCH AN AFFAIR I SAW A ROW OF PILGRIMS SQUIRTING LEAD IN 
THE AIR OUT OF WINCHESTERS HELD TO THE HIP I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER GET 
BACK TO THE STEAMER AND IMAGINED MYSELF LIVING ALONE AND UNARMED IN THE 
WOODS TO AN ADVANCED AGE SUCH SILLY THINGSYOU KNOW AND I REMEMBER 
I CONFOUNDED THE BEAT OF THE DRUM WITH THE BEATING OF MY HEART AND WAS 
PLEASED AT ITS CALM REGULARITY 
 
I KEPT TO THE TRACK THOUGHTHEN STOPPED TO LISTEN THE NIGHT WAS VERY 
CLEAR A DARK BLUE SPACE SPARKLING WITH DEW AND STARLIGHT IN WHICH 
BLACK THINGS STOOD VERY STILL I THOUGHT I COULD SEE A KIND OF MOTION 
AHEAD OF ME I WAS STRANGELY COCKSURE OF EVERYTHING THAT NIGHT I 
ACTUALLY LEFT THE TRACK AND RAN IN A WIDE SEMICIRCLE I VERILY BELIEVE 
CHUCKLING TO MYSELF SO AS TO GET IN FRONT OF THAT STIR OF THAT MOTION 
I HAD SEENIF INDEED I HAD SEEN ANYTHING I WAS CIRCUMVENTING KURTZ AS 
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A BOYISH GAME 
 
I CAME UPON HIM AND IF HE HAD NOT HEARD ME COMING I WOULD HAVE 
FALLEN OVER HIM TOO BUT HE GOT UP IN TIME HE ROSE UNSTEADY LONG 
PALE INDISTINCT LIKE A VAPOR EXHALED BY THE EARTH AND SWAYED 
SLIGHTLY MISTY AND SILENT BEFORE ME WHILE AT MY BACK THE FIRES LOOMED 
BETWEEN THE TREES AND THE MURMUR OF MANY VOICES ISSUED FROM THE FOREST 
I HAD CUT HIM OFF CLEVERLY BUT WHEN ACTUALLY CONFRONTING HIM I SEEMED 
TO COME TO MY SENSES I SAW THE DANGER IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTION IT WAS 
BY NO MEANS OVER YET SUPPOSE HE BEGAN TO SHOUT THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY 
STAND THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF VIGOR IN HIS VOICE GO AWAYHIDE 
YOURSELF HE SAID IN THAT PROFOUND TONE IT WAS VERY AWFUL I GLANCED 
BACK WE WERE WITHIN THIRTY YARDS FROM THE NEAREST FIRE A BLACK FIGURE 
STOOD UP STRODE ON LONG BLACK LEGS WAVING LONG BLACK ARMS ACROSS THE 
GLOW IT HAD HORNSANTELOPE HORNS I THINKON ITS HEAD SOME SORCERER 
SOME WITCHMAN NO DOUBT IT LOOKED FIENDLIKE ENOUGH DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
YOU ARE DOING I WHISPERED PERFECTLY HE ANSWERED RAISING HIS VOICE 
FOR THAT SINGLE WORD IT SOUNDED TO ME FAR OFF AND YET LOUD LIKE A HAIL 
THROUGH A SPEAKINGTRUMPET IF HE MAKES A ROW WE ARE LOST I THOUGHT 
TO MYSELF THIS CLEARLY WAS NOT A CASE FOR FISTICUFFS EVEN APART FROM 
THE VERY NATURAL AVERSION I HAD TO BEAT THAT SHADOWTHIS WANDERING AND 
TORMENTED THING YOU WILL BE LOST I SAIDUTTERLY LOST ONE GETS 
SOMETIMES SUCH A FLASH OF INSPIRATION YOU KNOW I DID SAY THE RIGHT 
THING THOUGH INDEED HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE IRRETRIEVABLY LOST THAN 
HE WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR INTIMACY WERE 
BEING LAIDTO ENDURETO ENDUREEVEN TO THE ENDEVEN BEYOND 
 
I HAD IMMENSE PLANS HE MUTTERED IRRESOLUTELY YES SAID I BUT IF 
YOU TRY TO SHOUT ILL SMASH YOUR HEAD WITH THERE WAS NOT A STICK OR 
A STONE NEAR I WILL THROTTLE YOU FOR GOOD I CORRECTED MYSELF I WAS 
ON THE THRESHOLD OF GREAT THINGS HE PLEADED IN A VOICE OF LONGING 
WITH A WISTFULNESS OF TONE THAT MADE MY BLOOD RUN COLD AND NOW FOR 
THIS STUPID SCOUNDREL YOUR SUCCESS IN EUROPE IS ASSURED IN ANY 
CASE I AFFIRMED STEADILY I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE THROTTLING OF 
HIM YOU UNDERSTANDAND INDEED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LITTLE USE FOR 
ANY PRACTICAL PURPOSE I TRIED TO BREAK THE SPELLTHE HEAVY MUTE SPELL 
OF THE WILDERNESSTHAT SEEMED TO DRAW HIM TO ITS PITILESS BREAST BY THE 
AWAKENING OF FORGOTTEN AND BRUTAL INSTINCTS BY THE MEMORY OF GRATIFIED 
AND MONSTROUS PASSIONS THIS ALONE I WAS CONVINCED HAD DRIVEN HIM OUT 
TO THE EDGE OF THE FOREST TO THE BUSH TOWARDS THE GLEAM OF FIRES THE 
THROB OF DRUMS THE DRONE OF WEIRD INCANTATIONS THIS ALONE HAD BEGUILED 
HIS UNLAWFUL SOUL BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF PERMITTED ASPIRATIONS AND DONT 
YOU SEE THE TERROR OF THE POSITION WAS NOT IN BEING KNOCKED ON THE 
HEADTHOUGH I HAD A VERY LIVELY SENSE OF THAT DANGER TOOBUT IN THIS 
THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH A BEING TO WHOM I COULD NOT APPEAL IN THE 
NAME OF ANYTHING HIGH OR LOW I HAD EVEN LIKE THE NIGGERS TO INVOKE 
HIMHIMSELF HIS OWN EXALTED AND INCREDIBLE DEGRADATION THERE WAS 
NOTHING EITHER ABOVE OR BELOW HIM AND I KNEW IT HE HAD KICKED HIMSELF 
LOOSE OF THE EARTH CONFOUND THE MAN HE HAD KICKED THE VERY EARTH TO 
PIECES HE WAS ALONE AND I BEFORE HIM DID NOT KNOW WHETHER I STOOD 
ON THE GROUND OR FLOATED IN THE AIR IVE BEEN TELLING YOU WHAT WE 
SAIDREPEATING THE PHRASES WE PRONOUNCEDBUT WHATS THE GOOD THEY 
WERE COMMON EVERYDAY WORDSTHE FAMILIAR VAGUE SOUNDS EXCHANGED ON 
EVERY WAKING DAY OF LIFE BUT WHAT OF THAT THEY HAD BEHIND THEM TO MY 
MIND THE TERRIFIC SUGGESTIVENESS OF WORDS HEARD IN DREAMS OF PHRASES 
SPOKEN IN NIGHTMARES SOUL IF ANYBODY HAD EVER STRUGGLED WITH A SOUL 
I AM THE MAN AND I WASNT ARGUING WITH A LUNATIC EITHER BELIEVE ME 
OR NOT HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS PERFECTLY CLEARCONCENTRATED IT IS TRUE 
UPON HIMSELF WITH HORRIBLE INTENSITY YET CLEAR AND THEREIN WAS MY ONLY 
CHANCEBARRING OF COURSE THE KILLING HIM THERE AND THEN WHICH WASNT 
SO GOOD ON ACCOUNT OF UNAVOIDABLE NOISE BUT HIS SOUL WAS MAD BEING 
ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS IT HAD LOOKED WITHIN ITSELF AND BY HEAVENS I 
TELL YOU IT HAD GONE MAD I HADFOR MY SINS I SUPPOSETO GO THROUGH 
THE ORDEAL OF LOOKING INTO IT MYSELF NO ELOQUENCE COULD HAVE BEEN SO 
WITHERING TO ONES BELIEF IN MANKIND AS HIS FINAL BURST OF SINCERITY 
HE STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF TOO I SAW ITI HEARD IT I SAW THE 
INCONCEIVABLE MYSTERY OF A SOUL THAT KNEW NO RESTRAINT NO FAITH AND 
NO FEAR YET STRUGGLING BLINDLY WITH ITSELF I KEPT MY HEAD PRETTY WELL 
BUT WHEN I HAD HIM AT LAST STRETCHED ON THE COUCH I WIPED MY FOREHEAD 
WHILE MY LEGS SHOOK UNDER ME AS THOUGH I HAD CARRIED HALF A TON ON MY 
BACK DOWN THAT HILL AND YET I HAD ONLY SUPPORTED HIM HIS BONY ARM 
CLASPED ROUND MY NECKAND HE WAS NOT MUCH HEAVIER THAN A CHILD 
 
WHEN NEXT DAY WE LEFT AT NOON THE CROWD OF WHOSE PRESENCE BEHIND THE 
CURTAIN OF TREES I HAD BEEN ACUTELY CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME FLOWED OUT 
OF THE WOODS AGAIN FILLED THE CLEARING COVERED THE SLOPE WITH A MASS 
OF NAKED BREATHING QUIVERING BRONZE BODIES I STEAMED UP A BIT THEN 
SWUNG DOWNSTREAM AND TWO THOUSAND EYES FOLLOWED THE EVOLUTIONS OF 
THE SPLASHING THUMPING FIERCE RIVERDEMON BEATING THE WATER WITH ITS 
TERRIBLE TAIL AND BREATHING BLACK SMOKE INTO THE AIR IN FRONT OF THE 
FIRST RANK ALONG THE RIVER THREE MEN PLASTERED WITH BRIGHT RED EARTH 
FROM HEAD TO FOOT STRUTTED TO AND FRO RESTLESSLY WHEN WE CAME ABREAST 
AGAIN THEY FACED THE RIVER STAMPED THEIR FEET NODDED THEIR HORNED 
HEADS SWAYED THEIR SCARLET BODIES THEY SHOOK TOWARDS THE FIERCE 
RIVERDEMON A BUNCH OF BLACK FEATHERS A MANGY SKIN WITH A PENDENT 
TAILSOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A DRIED GOURD THEY SHOUTED 
PERIODICALLY TOGETHER STRINGS OF AMAZING WORDS THAT RESEMBLED NO SOUNDS 
OF HUMAN LANGUAGE AND THE DEEP MURMURS OF THE CROWD INTERRUPTED 
SUDDENLY WERE LIKE THE RESPONSE OF SOME SATANIC LITANY 
 
WE HAD CARRIED KURTZ INTO THE PILOTHOUSE THERE WAS MORE AIR THERE 
LYING ON THE COUCH HE STARED THROUGH THE OPEN SHUTTER THERE WAS AN 
EDDY IN THE MASS OF HUMAN BODIES AND THE WOMAN WITH HELMETED HEAD AND 
TAWNY CHEEKS RUSHED OUT TO THE VERY BRINK OF THE STREAM SHE PUT OUT HER 
HANDS SHOUTED SOMETHING AND ALL THAT WILD MOB TOOK UP THE SHOUT IN A 
ROARING CHORUS OF ARTICULATED RAPID BREATHLESS UTTERANCE 
 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS I ASKED 
 
HE KEPT ON LOOKING OUT PAST ME WITH FIERY LONGING EYES WITH A MINGLED 
EXPRESSION OF WISTFULNESS AND HATE HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT I SAW A 
SMILE A SMILE OF INDEFINABLE MEANING APPEAR ON HIS COLORLESS LIPS 
THAT A MOMENT AFTER TWITCHED CONVULSIVELY DO I NOT HE SAID SLOWLY 
GASPING AS IF THE WORDS HAD BEEN TORN OUT OF HIM BY A SUPERNATURAL 
POWER 
 
I PULLED THE STRING OF THE WHISTLE AND I DID THIS BECAUSE I SAW THE 
PILGRIMS ON DECK GETTING OUT THEIR RIFLES WITH AN AIR OF ANTICIPATING A 
JOLLY LARK AT THE SUDDEN SCREECH THERE WAS A MOVEMENT OF ABJECT TERROR 
THROUGH THAT WEDGED MASS OF BODIES DONT DONT YOU FRIGHTEN THEM 
AWAY CRIED SOMEONE ON DECK DISCONSOLATELY I PULLED THE STRING 
TIME AFTER TIME THEY BROKE AND RAN THEY LEAPED THEY CROUCHED THEY 
SWERVED THEY DODGED THE FLYING TERROR OF THE SOUND THE THREE RED CHAPS 
HAD FALLEN FLAT FACE DOWN ON THE SHORE AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN SHOT 
DEAD ONLY THE BARBAROUS AND SUPERB WOMAN DID NOT SO MUCH AS FLINCH 
AND STRETCHED TRAGICALLY HER BARE ARMS AFTER US OVER THE SOMBER AND 
GLITTERING RIVER 
 
AND THEN THAT IMBECILE CROWD DOWN ON THE DECK STARTED THEIR LITTLE FUN 
AND I COULD SEE NOTHING MORE FOR SMOKE 
 
THE BROWN CURRENT RAN SWIFTLY OUT OF THE HEART OF DARKNESS BEARING US 
DOWN TOWARDS THE SEA WITH TWICE THE SPEED OF OUR UPWARD PROGRESS AND 
KURTZS LIFE WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY TOO EBBING EBBING OUT OF HIS HEART 
INTO THE SEA OF INEXORABLE TIME THE MANAGER WAS VERY PLACID HE HAD 
NO VITAL ANXIETIES NOW HE TOOK US BOTH IN WITH A COMPREHENSIVE AND 
SATISFIED GLANCE THE AFFAIR HAD COME OFF AS WELL AS COULD BE WISHED 
I SAW THE TIME APPROACHING WHEN I WOULD BE LEFT ALONE OF THE PARTY OF 
UNSOUND METHOD THE PILGRIMS LOOKED UPON ME WITH DISFAVOR I WAS 
SO TO SPEAK NUMBERED WITH THE DEAD IT IS STRANGE HOW I ACCEPTED THIS 
UNFORESEEN PARTNERSHIP THIS CHOICE OF NIGHTMARES FORCED UPON ME IN THE 
TENEBROUS LAND INVADED BY THESE MEAN AND GREEDY PHANTOMS 
 
KURTZ DISCOURSED A VOICE A VOICE IT RANG DEEP TO THE VERY LAST IT 
SURVIVED HIS STRENGTH TO HIDE IN THE MAGNIFICENT FOLDS OF ELOQUENCE THE 
BARREN DARKNESS OF HIS HEART OH HE STRUGGLED HE STRUGGLED THE WASTES 
OF HIS WEARY BRAIN WERE HAUNTED BY SHADOWY IMAGES NOWIMAGES OF WEALTH 
AND FAME REVOLVING OBSEQUIOUSLY ROUND HIS UNEXTINGUISHABLE GIFT OF 
NOBLE AND LOFTY EXPRESSION MY INTENDED MY STATION MY CAREER MY 
IDEASTHESE WERE THE SUBJECTS FOR THE OCCASIONAL UTTERANCES OF ELEVATED 
SENTIMENTS THE SHADE OF THE ORIGINAL KURTZ FREQUENTED THE BEDSIDE OF 
THE HOLLOW SHAM WHOSE FATE IT WAS TO BE BURIED PRESENTLY IN THE MOLD OF 
PRIMEVAL EARTH BUT BOTH THE DIABOLIC LOVE AND THE UNEARTHLY HATE OF 
THE MYSTERIES IT HAD PENETRATED FOUGHT FOR THE POSSESSION OF THAT 
SOUL SATIATED WITH PRIMITIVE EMOTIONS AVID OF LYING FAME OF SHAM 
DISTINCTION OF ALL THE APPEARANCES OF SUCCESS AND POWER 
 
SOMETIMES HE WAS CONTEMPTIBLY CHILDISH HE DESIRED TO HAVE KINGS MEET 
HIM AT RAILWAYSTATIONS ON HIS RETURN FROM SOME GHASTLY NOWHERE WHERE 
HE INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS YOU SHOW THEM YOU HAVE IN YOU 
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY PROFITABLE AND THEN THERE WILL BE NO LIMITS TO 
THE RECOGNITION OF YOUR ABILITY HE WOULD SAY OF COURSE YOU MUST TAKE 
CARE OF THE MOTIVESRIGHT MOTIVESALWAYS THE LONG REACHES THAT WERE 
LIKE ONE AND THE SAME REACH MONOTONOUS BENDS THAT WERE EXACTLY ALIKE 
SLIPPED PAST THE STEAMER WITH THEIR MULTITUDE OF SECULAR TREES LOOKING 
PATIENTLY AFTER THIS GRIMY FRAGMENT OF ANOTHER WORLD THE FORERUNNER 
OF CHANGE OF CONQUEST OF TRADE OF MASSACRES OF BLESSINGS I LOOKED 
AHEADPILOTING CLOSE THE SHUTTER SAID KURTZ SUDDENLY ONE DAY I 
CANT BEAR TO LOOK AT THIS I DID SO THERE WAS A SILENCE OH BUT I 
WILL WRING YOUR HEART YET HE CRIED AT THE INVISIBLE WILDERNESS 
 
WE BROKE DOWNAS I HAD EXPECTEDAND HAD TO LIE UP FOR REPAIRS AT THE 
HEAD OF AN ISLAND THIS DELAY WAS THE FIRST THING THAT SHOOK 
KURTZS CONFIDENCE ONE MORNING HE GAVE ME A PACKET OF PAPERS AND A 
PHOTOGRAPHTHE LOT TIED TOGETHER WITH A SHOESTRING KEEP THIS FOR 
ME HE SAID THIS NOXIOUS FOOL MEANING THE MANAGER IS CAPABLE OF 
PRYING INTO MY BOXES WHEN I AM NOT LOOKING IN THE AFTERNOON I SAW HIM 
HE WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH CLOSED EYES AND I WITHDREW QUIETLY BUT 
I HEARD HIM MUTTER LIVE RIGHTLY DIE DIE    I LISTENED THERE WAS 
NOTHING MORE WAS HE REHEARSING SOME SPEECH IN HIS SLEEP OR WAS IT A 
FRAGMENT OF A PHRASE FROM SOME NEWSPAPER ARTICLE HE HAD BEEN WRITING 
FOR THE PAPERS AND MEANT TO DO SO AGAIN FOR THE FURTHERING OF MY 
IDEAS ITS A DUTY 
 
HIS WAS AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I LOOKED AT HIM AS YOU PEER DOWN AT 
A MAN WHO IS LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF A PRECIPICE WHERE THE SUN NEVER 
SHINES BUT I HAD NOT MUCH TIME TO GIVE HIM BECAUSE I WAS HELPING THE 
ENGINEDRIVER TO TAKE TO PIECES THE LEAKY CYLINDERS TO STRAIGHTEN A 
BENT CONNECTINGROD AND IN OTHER SUCH MATTERS I LIVED IN AN 
INFERNAL MESS OF RUST FILINGS NUTS BOLTS SPANNERS HAMMERS 
RATCHETDRILLSTHINGS I ABOMINATE BECAUSE I DONT GET ON WITH THEM I 
TENDED THE LITTLE FORGE WE FORTUNATELY HAD ABOARD I TOILED WEARILY IN A 
WRETCHED SCRAPHEAPUNLESS I HAD THE SHAKES TOO BAD TO STAND 
 
ONE EVENING COMING IN WITH A CANDLE I WAS STARTLED TO HEAR HIM SAY A 
LITTLE TREMULOUSLY I AM LYING HERE IN THE DARK WAITING FOR DEATH 
THE LIGHT WAS WITHIN A FOOT OF HIS EYES I FORCED MYSELF TO MURMUR OH 
NONSENSE AND STOOD OVER HIM AS IF TRANSFIXED 
 
ANYTHING APPROACHING THE CHANGE THAT CAME OVER HIS FEATURES I HAVE 
NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND HOPE NEVER TO SEE AGAIN OH I WASNT TOUCHED 
I WAS FASCINATED IT WAS AS THOUGH A VEIL HAD BEEN RENT I SAW ON THAT 
IVORY FACE THE EXPRESSION OF SOMBER PRIDE OF RUTHLESS POWER OF CRAVEN 
TERROROF AN INTENSE AND HOPELESS DESPAIR DID HE LIVE HIS LIFE AGAIN 
IN EVERY DETAIL OF DESIRE TEMPTATION AND SURRENDER DURING THAT SUPREME 
MOMENT OF COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE HE CRIED IN A WHISPER AT SOME IMAGE AT 
SOME VISIONHE CRIED OUT TWICE A CRY THAT WAS NO MORE THAN A BREATH 
 
THE HORROR THE HORROR 
 
I BLEW THE CANDLE OUT AND LEFT THE CABIN THE PILGRIMS WERE DINING IN 
THE MESSROOM AND I TOOK MY PLACE OPPOSITE THE MANAGER WHO LIFTED HIS 
EYES TO GIVE ME A QUESTIONING GLANCE WHICH I SUCCESSFULLY IGNORED 
HE LEANED BACK SERENE WITH THAT PECULIAR SMILE OF HIS SEALING THE 
UNEXPRESSED DEPTHS OF HIS MEANNESS A CONTINUOUS SHOWER OF SMALL FLIES 
STREAMED UPON THE LAMP UPON THE CLOTH UPON OUR HANDS AND FACES 
SUDDENLY THE MANAGERS BOY PUT HIS INSOLENT BLACK HEAD IN THE DOORWAY 
AND SAID IN A TONE OF SCATHING CONTEMPT 
 
MISTAH KURTZHE DEAD 
 
ALL THE PILGRIMS RUSHED OUT TO SEE I REMAINED AND WENT ON WITH MY 
DINNER I BELIEVE I WAS CONSIDERED BRUTALLY CALLOUS HOWEVER I DID NOT 
EAT MUCH THERE WAS A LAMP IN THERELIGHT DONT YOU KNOWAND OUTSIDE 
IT WAS SO BEASTLY BEASTLY DARK I WENT NO MORE NEAR THE REMARKABLE MAN 
WHO HAD PRONOUNCED A JUDGMENT UPON THE ADVENTURES OF HIS SOUL ON THIS 
EARTH THE VOICE WAS GONE WHAT ELSE HAD BEEN THERE BUT I AM OF COURSE 
AWARE THAT NEXT DAY THE PILGRIMS BURIED SOMETHING IN A MUDDY HOLE 
 
AND THEN THEY VERY NEARLY BURIED ME 
 
HOWEVER AS YOU SEE I DID NOT GO TO JOIN KURTZ THERE AND THEN I DID 
NOT I REMAINED TO DREAM THE NIGHTMARE OUT TO THE END AND TO SHOW 
MY LOYALTY TO KURTZ ONCE MORE DESTINY MY DESTINY DROLL THING LIFE 
ISTHAT MYSTERIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF MERCILESS LOGIC FOR A FUTILE PURPOSE 
THE MOST YOU CAN HOPE FROM IT IS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF YOURSELFTHAT COMES 
TOO LATEA CROP OF UNEXTINGUISHABLE REGRETS I HAVE WRESTLED WITH 
DEATH IT IS THE MOST UNEXCITING CONTEST YOU CAN IMAGINE IT TAKES PLACE 
IN AN IMPALPABLE GRAYNESS WITH NOTHING UNDERFOOT WITH NOTHING AROUND 
WITHOUT SPECTATORS WITHOUT CLAMOR WITHOUT GLORY WITHOUT THE GREAT 
DESIRE OF VICTORY WITHOUT THE GREAT FEAR OF DEFEAT IN A SICKLY 
ATMOSPHERE OF TEPID SKEPTICISM WITHOUT MUCH BELIEF IN YOUR OWN RIGHT 
AND STILL LESS IN THAT OF YOUR ADVERSARY IF SUCH IS THE FORM OF 
ULTIMATE WISDOM THEN LIFE IS A GREATER RIDDLE THAN SOME OF US THINK 
IT TO BE I WAS WITHIN A HAIRSBREADTH OF THE LAST OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PRONOUNCEMENT AND I FOUND WITH HUMILIATION THAT PROBABLY I WOULD 
HAVE NOTHING TO SAY THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AFFIRM THAT KURTZ WAS A 
REMARKABLE MAN HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY HE SAID IT SINCE I HAD PEEPED 
OVER THE EDGE MYSELF I UNDERSTAND BETTER THE MEANING OF HIS STARE THAT 
COULD NOT SEE THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE BUT WAS WIDE ENOUGH TO EMBRACE 
THE WHOLE UNIVERSE PIERCING ENOUGH TO PENETRATE ALL THE HEARTS THAT 
BEAT IN THE DARKNESS HE HAD SUMMED UPHE HAD JUDGED THE HORROR HE 
WAS A REMARKABLE MAN AFTER ALL THIS WAS THE EXPRESSION OF SOME SORT 
OF BELIEF IT HAD CANDOR IT HAD CONVICTION IT HAD A VIBRATING NOTE 
OF REVOLT IN ITS WHISPER IT HAD THE APPALLING FACE OF A GLIMPSED 
TRUTHTHE STRANGE COMMINGLING OF DESIRE AND HATE AND IT IS NOT MY OWN 
EXTREMITY I REMEMBER BESTA VISION OF GRAYNESS WITHOUT FORM FILLED 
WITH PHYSICAL PAIN AND A CARELESS CONTEMPT FOR THE EVANESCENCE OF ALL 
THINGSEVEN OF THIS PAIN ITSELF NO IT IS HIS EXTREMITY THAT I SEEM TO 
HAVE LIVED THROUGH TRUE HE HAD MADE THAT LAST STRIDE HE HAD STEPPED 
OVER THE EDGE WHILE I HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO DRAW BACK MY HESITATING 
FOOT AND PERHAPS IN THIS IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE PERHAPS ALL THE 
WISDOM AND ALL TRUTH AND ALL SINCERITY ARE JUST COMPRESSED INTO THAT 
INAPPRECIABLE MOMENT OF TIME IN WHICH WE STEP OVER THE THRESHOLD OF THE 
INVISIBLE PERHAPS I LIKE TO THINK MY SUMMINGUP WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
A WORD OF CARELESS CONTEMPT BETTER HIS CRYMUCH BETTER IT WAS 
AN AFFIRMATION A MORAL VICTORY PAID FOR BY INNUMERABLE DEFEATS BY 
ABOMINABLE TERRORS BY ABOMINABLE SATISFACTIONS BUT IT WAS A VICTORY 
THAT IS WHY I HAVE REMAINED LOYAL TO KURTZ TO THE LAST AND EVEN BEYOND 
WHEN A LONG TIME AFTER I HEARD ONCE MORE NOT HIS OWN VOICE BUT 
THE ECHO OF HIS MAGNIFICENT ELOQUENCE THROWN TO ME FROM A SOUL AS 
TRANSLUCENTLY PURE AS A CLIFF OF CRYSTAL 
 
NO THEY DID NOT BURY ME THOUGH THERE IS A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH I 
REMEMBER MISTILY WITH A SHUDDERING WONDER LIKE A PASSAGE THROUGH SOME 
INCONCEIVABLE WORLD THAT HAD NO HOPE IN IT AND NO DESIRE I FOUND MYSELF 
BACK IN THE SEPULCHRAL CITY RESENTING THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE HURRYING 
THROUGH THE STREETS TO FILCH A LITTLE MONEY FROM EACH OTHER TO DEVOUR 
THEIR INFAMOUS COOKERY TO GULP THEIR UNWHOLESOME BEER TO DREAM THEIR 
INSIGNIFICANT AND SILLY DREAMS THEY TRESPASSED UPON MY THOUGHTS THEY 
WERE INTRUDERS WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WAS TO ME AN IRRITATING PRETENSE 
BECAUSE I FELT SO SURE THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY KNOW THE THINGS I KNEW 
THEIR BEARING WHICH WAS SIMPLY THE BEARING OF COMMONPLACE INDIVIDUALS 
GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS IN THE ASSURANCE OF PERFECT SAFETY WAS 
OFFENSIVE TO ME LIKE THE OUTRAGEOUS FLAUNTINGS OF FOLLY IN THE FACE OF 
A DANGER IT IS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND I HAD NO PARTICULAR DESIRE TO 
ENLIGHTEN THEM BUT I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN RESTRAINING MYSELF FROM 
LAUGHING IN THEIR FACES SO FULL OF STUPID IMPORTANCE I DARE SAY I WAS 
NOT VERY WELL AT THAT TIME I TOTTERED ABOUT THE STREETSTHERE WERE 
VARIOUS AFFAIRS TO SETTLEGRINNING BITTERLY AT PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE 
PERSONS I ADMIT MY BEHAVIOR WAS INEXCUSABLE BUT THEN MY TEMPERATURE 
WAS SELDOM NORMAL IN THESE DAYS MY DEAR AUNTS ENDEAVORS TO NURSE UP 
MY STRENGTH SEEMED ALTOGETHER BESIDE THE MARK IT WAS NOT MY STRENGTH 
THAT WANTED NURSING IT WAS MY IMAGINATION THAT WANTED SOOTHING I KEPT 
THE BUNDLE OF PAPERS GIVEN ME BY KURTZ NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT TO DO 
WITH IT HIS MOTHER HAD DIED LATELY WATCHED OVER AS I WAS TOLD BY 
HIS INTENDED A CLEANSHAVED MAN WITH AN OFFICIAL MANNER AND WEARING 
GOLDRIMMED SPECTACLES CALLED ON ME ONE DAY AND MADE INQUIRIES AT 
FIRST CIRCUITOUS AFTERWARDS SUAVELY PRESSING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS PLEASED 
TO DENOMINATE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS I WAS NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAD 
HAD TWO ROWS WITH THE MANAGER ON THE SUBJECT OUT THERE I HAD REFUSED 
TO GIVE UP THE SMALLEST SCRAP OUT OF THAT PACKAGE AND I TOOK THE SAME 
ATTITUDE WITH THE SPECTACLED MAN HE BECAME DARKLY MENACING AT LAST 
AND WITH MUCH HEAT ARGUED THAT THE COMPANY HAD THE RIGHT TO EVERY BIT 
OF INFORMATION ABOUT ITS TERRITORIES AND SAID HE MR KURTZS 
KNOWLEDGE OF UNEXPLORED REGIONS MUST HAVE BEEN NECESSARILY EXTENSIVE 
AND PECULIAROWING TO HIS GREAT ABILITIES AND TO THE DEPLORABLE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN PLACED THEREFOREI ASSURED HIM MR 
KURTZS KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER EXTENSIVE DID NOT BEAR UPON THE PROBLEMS 
OF COMMERCE OR ADMINISTRATION HE INVOKED THEN THE NAME OF SCIENCE IT 
WOULD BE AN INCALCULABLE LOSS IF C C I OFFERED HIM THE REPORT ON 
THE SUPPRESSION OF SAVAGE CUSTOMS WITH THE POSTSCRIPTUM TORN OFF HE 
TOOK IT UP EAGERLY BUT ENDED BY SNIFFING AT IT WITH AN AIR OF CONTEMPT 
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT HE REMARKED EXPECT 
NOTHING ELSE I SAID THERE ARE ONLY PRIVATE LETTERS HE WITHDREW 
UPON SOME THREAT OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND I SAW HIM NO MORE BUT 
ANOTHER FELLOW CALLING HIMSELF KURTZS COUSIN APPEARED TWO DAYS LATER 
AND WAS ANXIOUS TO HEAR ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT HIS DEAR RELATIVES LAST 
MOMENTS INCIDENTALLY HE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT KURTZ HAD BEEN 
ESSENTIALLY A GREAT MUSICIAN THERE WAS THE MAKING OF AN IMMENSE 
SUCCESS SAID THE MAN WHO WAS AN ORGANIST I BELIEVE WITH LANK GRAY 
HAIR FLOWING OVER A GREASY COATCOLLAR I HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT 
HIS STATEMENT AND TO THIS DAY I AM UNABLE TO SAY WHAT WAS KURTZS 
PROFESSION WHETHER HE EVER HAD ANYWHICH WAS THE GREATEST OF HIS 
TALENTS I HAD TAKEN HIM FOR A PAINTER WHO WROTE FOR THE PAPERS OR ELSE 
FOR A JOURNALIST WHO COULD PAINTBUT EVEN THE COUSIN WHO TOOK SNUFF 
DURING THE INTERVIEW COULD NOT TELL ME WHAT HE HAD BEENEXACTLY HE 
WAS A UNIVERSAL GENIUSON THAT POINT I AGREED WITH THE OLD CHAP WHO 
THEREUPON BLEW HIS NOSE NOISILY INTO A LARGE COTTON HANDKERCHIEF AND 
WITHDREW IN SENILE AGITATION BEARING OFF SOME FAMILY LETTERS AND 
MEMORANDA WITHOUT IMPORTANCE ULTIMATELY A JOURNALIST ANXIOUS TO KNOW 
SOMETHING OF THE FATE OF HIS DEAR COLLEAGUE TURNED UP THIS VISITOR 
INFORMED ME KURTZS PROPER SPHERE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN POLITICS ON THE 
POPULAR SIDE HE HAD FURRY STRAIGHT EYEBROWS BRISTLY HAIR CROPPED 
SHORT AN EYEGLASS ON A BROAD RIBBON AND BECOMING EXPANSIVE 
CONFESSED HIS OPINION THAT KURTZ REALLY COULDNT WRITE A BITBUT 
HEAVENS HOW THAT MAN COULD TALK HE ELECTRIFIED LARGE MEETINGS HE HAD 
FAITHDONT YOU SEEHE HAD THE FAITH HE COULD GET HIMSELF TO BELIEVE 
ANYTHINGANYTHING HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SPLENDID LEADER OF AN EXTREME 
PARTY WHAT PARTY I ASKED ANY PARTY ANSWERED THE OTHER HE 
WAS ANANEXTREMIST DID I NOT THINK SO I ASSENTED DID I KNOW HE 
ASKED WITH A SUDDEN FLASH OF CURIOSITY WHAT IT WAS THAT HAD INDUCED 
HIM TO GO OUT THERE YES SAID I AND FORTHWITH HANDED HIM THE 
FAMOUS REPORT FOR PUBLICATION IF HE THOUGHT FIT HE GLANCED THROUGH IT 
HURRIEDLY MUMBLING ALL THE TIME JUDGED IT WOULD DO AND TOOK HIMSELF 
OFF WITH THIS PLUNDER 
 
THUS I WAS LEFT AT LAST WITH A SLIM PACKET OF LETTERS AND THE GIRLS 
PORTRAIT SHE STRUCK ME AS BEAUTIFULI MEAN SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL 
EXPRESSION I KNOW THAT THE SUNLIGHT CAN BE MADE TO LIE TOO YET ONE 
FELT THAT NO MANIPULATION OF LIGHT AND POSE COULD HAVE CONVEYED THE 
DELICATE SHADE OF TRUTHFULNESS UPON THOSE FEATURES SHE SEEMED READY TO 
LISTEN WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION WITHOUT SUSPICION WITHOUT A THOUGHT 
FOR HERSELF I CONCLUDED I WOULD GO AND GIVE HER BACK HER PORTRAIT 
AND THOSE LETTERS MYSELF CURIOSITY YES AND ALSO SOME OTHER FEELING 
PERHAPS ALL THAT HAD BEEN KURTZS HAD PASSED OUT OF MY HANDS HIS SOUL 
HIS BODY HIS STATION HIS PLANS HIS IVORY HIS CAREER THERE REMAINED 
ONLY HIS MEMORY AND HIS INTENDEDAND I WANTED TO GIVE THAT UP TOO TO 
THE PAST IN A WAYTO SURRENDER PERSONALLY ALL THAT REMAINED OF HIM 
WITH ME TO THAT OBLIVION WHICH IS THE LAST WORD OF OUR COMMON FATE I 
DONT DEFEND MYSELF I HAD NO CLEAR PERCEPTION OF WHAT IT WAS I REALLY 
WANTED PERHAPS IT WAS AN IMPULSE OF UNCONSCIOUS LOYALTY OR THE 
FULFILLMENT OF ONE OF THESE IRONIC NECESSITIES THAT LURK IN THE FACTS OF 
HUMAN EXISTENCE I DONT KNOW I CANT TELL BUT I WENT 
 
I THOUGHT HIS MEMORY WAS LIKE THE OTHER MEMORIES OF THE DEAD THAT 
ACCUMULATE IN EVERY MANS LIFEA VAGUE IMPRESS ON THE BRAIN OF SHADOWS 
THAT HAD FALLEN ON IT IN THEIR SWIFT AND FINAL PASSAGE BUT BEFORE THE 
HIGH AND PONDEROUS DOOR BETWEEN THE TALL HOUSES OF A STREET AS STILL 
AND DECOROUS AS A WELLKEPT ALLEY IN A CEMETERY I HAD A VISION OF HIM 
ON THE STRETCHER OPENING HIS MOUTH VORACIOUSLY AS IF TO DEVOUR ALL THE 
EARTH WITH ALL ITS MANKIND HE LIVED THEN BEFORE ME HE LIVED AS MUCH 
AS HE HAD EVER LIVEDA SHADOW INSATIABLE OF SPLENDID APPEARANCES OF 
FRIGHTFUL REALITIES A SHADOW DARKER THAN THE SHADOW OF THE NIGHT AND 
DRAPED NOBLY IN THE FOLDS OF A GORGEOUS ELOQUENCE THE VISION SEEMED TO 
ENTER THE HOUSE WITH METHE STRETCHER THE PHANTOMBEARERS THE WILD 
CROWD OF OBEDIENT WORSHIPERS THE GLOOM OF THE FORESTS THE GLITTER OF 
THE REACH BETWEEN THE MURKY BENDS THE BEAT OF THE DRUM REGULAR AND 
MUFFLED LIKE THE BEATING OF A HEARTTHE HEART OF A CONQUERING DARKNESS 
IT WAS A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH FOR THE WILDERNESS AN INVADING AND VENGEFUL 
RUSH WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME I WOULD HAVE TO KEEP BACK ALONE FOR THE 
SALVATION OF ANOTHER SOUL AND THE MEMORY OF WHAT I HAD HEARD HIM SAY 
AFAR THERE WITH THE HORNED SHAPES STIRRING AT MY BACK IN THE GLOW OF 
FIRES WITHIN THE PATIENT WOODS THOSE BROKEN PHRASES CAME BACK TO 
ME WERE HEARD AGAIN IN THEIR OMINOUS AND TERRIFYING SIMPLICITY I 
REMEMBERED HIS ABJECT PLEADING HIS ABJECT THREATS THE COLOSSAL SCALE 
OF HIS VILE DESIRES THE MEANNESS THE TORMENT THE TEMPESTUOUS ANGUISH 
OF HIS SOUL AND LATER ON I SEEMED TO SEE HIS COLLECTED LANGUID MANNER 
WHEN HE SAID ONE DAY THIS LOT OF IVORY NOW IS REALLY MINE THE COMPANY 
DID NOT PAY FOR IT I COLLECTED IT MYSELF AT A VERY GREAT PERSONAL RISK 
I AM AFRAID THEY WILL TRY TO CLAIM IT AS THEIRS THOUGH HM IT IS A 
DIFFICULT CASE WHAT DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO DORESIST EH I WANT NO 
MORE THAN JUSTICE    HE WANTED NO MORE THAN JUSTICENO MORE THAN 
JUSTICE I RANG THE BELL BEFORE A MAHOGANY DOOR ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND 
WHILE I WAITED HE SEEMED TO STARE AT ME OUT OF THE GLASSY PANELSTARE 
WITH THAT WIDE AND IMMENSE STARE EMBRACING CONDEMNING LOATHING ALL THE 
UNIVERSE I SEEMED TO HEAR THE WHISPERED CRY THE HORROR THE HORROR 
 
THE DUSK WAS FALLING I HAD TO WAIT IN A LOFTY DRAWINGROOM WITH THREE 
LONG WINDOWS FROM FLOOR TO CEILING THAT WERE LIKE THREE LUMINOUS AND 
BEDRAPED COLUMNS THE BENT GILT LEGS AND BACKS OF THE FURNITURE SHONE IN 
INDISTINCT CURVES THE TALL MARBLE FIREPLACE HAD A COLD AND MONUMENTAL 
WHITENESS A GRAND PIANO STOOD MASSIVELY IN A CORNER WITH DARK GLEAMS 
ON THE FLAT SURFACES LIKE A SOMBER AND POLISHED SARCOPHAGUS A HIGH DOOR 
OPENEDCLOSED I ROSE 
 
SHE CAME FORWARD ALL IN BLACK WITH A PALE HEAD FLOATING TOWARDS 
ME IN THE DUSK SHE WAS IN MOURNING IT WAS MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE HIS 
DEATH MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE THE NEWS CAME SHE SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE 
WOULD REMEMBER AND MOURN FOR EVER SHE TOOK BOTH MY HANDS IN HERS AND 
MURMURED I HAD HEARD YOU WERE COMING I NOTICED SHE WAS NOT VERY 
YOUNGI MEAN NOT GIRLISH SHE HAD A MATURE CAPACITY FOR FIDELITY FOR 
BELIEF FOR SUFFERING THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN DARKER AS IF ALL 
THE SAD LIGHT OF THE CLOUDY EVENING HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON HER FOREHEAD 
THIS FAIR HAIR THIS PALE VISAGE THIS PURE BROW SEEMED SURROUNDED BY 
AN ASHY HALO FROM WHICH THE DARK EYES LOOKED OUT AT ME THEIR GLANCE WAS 
GUILELESS PROFOUND CONFIDENT AND TRUSTFUL SHE CARRIED HER SORROWFUL 
HEAD AS THOUGH SHE WERE PROUD OF THAT SORROW AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SAY 
II ALONE KNOW HOW TO MOURN FOR HIM AS HE DESERVES BUT WHILE WE WERE 
STILL SHAKING HANDS SUCH A LOOK OF AWFUL DESOLATION CAME UPON HER 
FACE THAT I PERCEIVED SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE CREATURES THAT ARE NOT THE 
PLAYTHINGS OF TIME FOR HER HE HAD DIED ONLY YESTERDAY AND BY JOVE 
THE IMPRESSION WAS SO POWERFUL THAT FOR ME TOO HE SEEMED TO HAVE DIED 
ONLY YESTERDAYNAY THIS VERY MINUTE I SAW HER AND HIM IN THE SAME 
INSTANT OF TIMEHIS DEATH AND HER SORROWI SAW HER SORROW IN THE VERY 
MOMENT OF HIS DEATH DO YOU UNDERSTAND I SAW THEM TOGETHERI HEARD 
THEM TOGETHER SHE HAD SAID WITH A DEEP CATCH OF THE BREATH I HAVE 
SURVIVED WHILE MY STRAINED EARS SEEMED TO HEAR DISTINCTLY MINGLED 
WITH HER TONE OF DESPAIRING REGRET THE SUMMINGUP WHISPER OF HIS 
ETERNAL CONDEMNATION I ASKED MYSELF WHAT I WAS DOING THERE WITH A 
SENSATION OF PANIC IN MY HEART AS THOUGH I HAD BLUNDERED INTO A PLACE 
OF CRUEL AND ABSURD MYSTERIES NOT FIT FOR A HUMAN BEING TO BEHOLD SHE 
MOTIONED ME TO A CHAIR WE SAT DOWN I LAID THE PACKET GENTLY ON THE 
LITTLE TABLE AND SHE PUT HER HAND OVER IT    YOU KNEW HIM WELL 
SHE MURMURED AFTER A MOMENT OF MOURNING SILENCE 
 
INTIMACY GROWS QUICK OUT THERE I SAID I KNEW HIM AS WELL AS IT IS 
POSSIBLE FOR ONE MAN TO KNOW ANOTHER 
 
AND YOU ADMIRED HIM SHE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW HIM AND NOT 
TO ADMIRE HIM WAS IT 
 
HE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN I SAID UNSTEADILY THEN BEFORE THE 
APPEALING FIXITY OF HER GAZE THAT SEEMED TO WATCH FOR MORE WORDS ON MY 
LIPS I WENT ON IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO 
 
LOVE HIM SHE FINISHED EAGERLY SILENCING ME INTO AN APPALLED 
DUMBNESS HOW TRUE HOW TRUE BUT WHEN YOU THINK THAT NO ONE KNEW HIM 
SO WELL AS I I HAD ALL HIS NOBLE CONFIDENCE I KNEW HIM BEST 
 
YOU KNEW HIM BEST I REPEATED AND PERHAPS SHE DID BUT WITH EVERY 
WORD SPOKEN THE ROOM WAS GROWING DARKER AND ONLY HER FOREHEAD SMOOTH 
AND WHITE REMAINED ILLUMINED BY THE UNEXTINGUISHABLE LIGHT OF BELIEF 
AND LOVE 
 
YOU WERE HIS FRIEND SHE WENT ON HIS FRIEND SHE REPEATED A 
LITTLE LOUDER YOU MUST HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD GIVEN YOU THIS AND SENT 
YOU TO ME I FEEL I CAN SPEAK TO YOUAND OH I MUST SPEAK I WANT 
YOUYOU WHO HAVE HEARD HIS LAST WORDSTO KNOW I HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF 
HIM    IT IS NOT PRIDE    YES I AM PROUD TO KNOW I UNDERSTOOD 
HIM BETTER THAN ANYONE ON EARTHHE TOLD ME SO HIMSELF AND SINCE HIS 
MOTHER DIED I HAVE HAD NO ONENO ONETOTO 
 
I LISTENED THE DARKNESS DEEPENED I WAS NOT EVEN SURE WHETHER HE HAD 
GIVEN ME THE RIGHT BUNDLE I RATHER SUSPECT HE WANTED ME TO TAKE CARE 
OF ANOTHER BATCH OF HIS PAPERS WHICH AFTER HIS DEATH I SAW THE MANAGER 
EXAMINING UNDER THE LAMP AND THE GIRL TALKED EASING HER PAIN IN THE 
CERTITUDE OF MY SYMPATHY SHE TALKED AS THIRSTY MEN DRINK I HAD HEARD 
THAT HER ENGAGEMENT WITH KURTZ HAD BEEN DISAPPROVED BY HER PEOPLE HE 
WASNT RICH ENOUGH OR SOMETHING AND INDEED I DONT KNOW WHETHER HE HAD 
NOT BEEN A PAUPER ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD GIVEN ME SOME REASON TO INFER 
THAT IT WAS HIS IMPATIENCE OF COMPARATIVE POVERTY THAT DROVE HIM OUT 
THERE 
 
   WHO WAS NOT HIS FRIEND WHO HAD HEARD HIM SPEAK ONCE SHE WAS 
SAYING HE DREW MEN TOWARDS HIM BY WHAT WAS BEST IN THEM SHE LOOKED 
AT ME WITH INTENSITY IT IS THE GIFT OF THE GREAT SHE WENT ON AND 
THE SOUND OF HER LOW VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF ALL 
THE OTHER SOUNDS FULL OF MYSTERY DESOLATION AND SORROW I HAD EVER 
HEARDTHE RIPPLE OF THE RIVER THE SOUGHING OF THE TREES SWAYED BY THE 
WIND THE MURMURS OF WILD CROWDS THE FAINT RING OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE 
WORDS CRIED FROM AFAR THE WHISPER OF A VOICE SPEAKING FROM BEYOND THE 
THRESHOLD OF AN ETERNAL DARKNESS BUT YOU HAVE HEARD HIM YOU KNOW 
SHE CRIED 
 
YES I KNOW I SAID WITH SOMETHING LIKE DESPAIR IN MY HEART BUT 
BOWING MY HEAD BEFORE THE FAITH THAT WAS IN HER BEFORE THAT GREAT AND 
SAVING ILLUSION THAT SHONE WITH AN UNEARTHLY GLOW IN THE DARKNESS IN 
THE TRIUMPHANT DARKNESS FROM WHICH I COULD NOT HAVE DEFENDED HERFROM 
WHICH I COULD NOT EVEN DEFEND MYSELF 
 
WHAT A LOSS TO METO USSHE CORRECTED HERSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL 
GENEROSITY THEN ADDED IN A MURMUR TO THE WORLD BY THE LAST GLEAMS 
OF TWILIGHT I COULD SEE THE GLITTER OF HER EYES FULL OF TEARSOF TEARS 
THAT WOULD NOT FALL 
 
I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPYVERY FORTUNATEVERY PROUD SHE WENT ON TOO 
FORTUNATE TOO HAPPY FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND NOW I AM UNHAPPY FORFOR 
LIFE 
 
SHE STOOD UP HER FAIR HAIR SEEMED TO CATCH ALL THE REMAINING LIGHT IN 
A GLIMMER OF GOLD I ROSE TOO 
 
AND OF ALL THIS SHE WENT ON MOURNFULLY OF ALL HIS PROMISE AND 
OF ALL HIS GREATNESS OF HIS GENEROUS MIND OF HIS NOBLE HEART NOTHING 
REMAINSNOTHING BUT A MEMORY YOU AND I 
 
WE SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM I SAID HASTILY 
 
NO SHE CRIED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ALL THIS SHOULD BE LOSTTHAT 
SUCH A LIFE SHOULD BE SACRIFICED TO LEAVE NOTHINGBUT SORROW YOU 
KNOW WHAT VAST PLANS HE HAD I KNEW OF THEM TOOI COULD NOT PERHAPS 
UNDERSTANDBUT OTHERS KNEW OF THEM SOMETHING MUST REMAIN HIS WORDS 
AT LEAST HAVE NOT DIED 
 
HIS WORDS WILL REMAIN I SAID 
 
AND HIS EXAMPLE SHE WHISPERED TO HERSELF MEN LOOKED UP TO 
HIMHIS GOODNESS SHONE IN EVERY ACT HIS EXAMPLE 
 
TRUE I SAID HIS EXAMPLE TOO YES HIS EXAMPLE I FORGOT THAT 
 
BUT I DO NOT I CANNOTI CANNOT BELIEVENOT YET I CANNOT BELIEVE 
THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN THAT NOBODY WILL SEE HIM AGAIN NEVER 
NEVER NEVER 
 
SHE PUT OUT HER ARMS AS IF AFTER A RETREATING FIGURE STRETCHING THEM 
BLACK AND WITH CLASPED PALE HANDS ACROSS THE FADING AND NARROW SHEEN OF 
THE WINDOW NEVER SEE HIM I SAW HIM CLEARLY ENOUGH THEN I SHALL SEE 
THIS ELOQUENT PHANTOM AS LONG AS I LIVE AND I SHALL SEE HER TOO A 
TRAGIC AND FAMILIAR SHADE RESEMBLING IN THIS GESTURE ANOTHER ONE 
TRAGIC ALSO AND BEDECKED WITH POWERLESS CHARMS STRETCHING BARE BROWN 
ARMS OVER THE GLITTER OF THE INFERNAL STREAM THE STREAM OF DARKNESS 
SHE SAID SUDDENLY VERY LOW HE DIED AS HE LIVED 
 
HIS END SAID I WITH DULL ANGER STIRRING IN ME WAS IN EVERY WAY 
WORTHY OF HIS LIFE 
 
AND I WAS NOT WITH HIM SHE MURMURED MY ANGER SUBSIDED BEFORE A 
FEELING OF INFINITE PITY 
 
EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE I MUMBLED 
 
AH BUT I BELIEVED IN HIM MORE THAN ANYONE ON EARTHMORE THAN HIS 
OWN MOTHER MORE THANHIMSELF HE NEEDED ME ME I WOULD HAVE TREASURED 
EVERY SIGH EVERY WORD EVERY SIGN EVERY GLANCE

OF UNSPEAKABLE PAIN I KNEW ITI WAS SURE    SHE KNEW SHE WAS
